Watch as Jeff tackles his 2nd Small Plays, this time playing a FPS horror game 1916 - Der Unbekannte Krieg!

Experience the horror and senselessness of war. The enemy constantly hidden in the fog ready to pounce. Fatigue and shellshock distorting your movement and ability. The stress of uncertainty and adrenaline of chase followed by attack. Here, salvation is the blinding epileptic bombardment of the battlefied.
