You got to be quick, slick and deadly to win this fight. Recently I got the chance to talk with Siavash Tazari from Adventurous Productions on their recently released game, Quick Slick Deadly which you can purchase on [Desura](http://www.desura.com/games/quick-slick-deadly) now or support them on [Steam Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=149389311). You can find out more about their game on their [website](http://quickslickdeadly.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** On the surface, Quick Slick Deadly is a scrolling shooter, but in this game, I have tried to add different elements to the shooting genre that are more reminiscent of platformers and role playing games. Quick Slick Deadly is more about manoeuvring and decision, rather than shooting and “bullet-hell”.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** Quick Slick Deadly is not a story driven game, but as far as giving the player an ultimate goal is concerned, there is a reward to unlock by finishing all missions with all classes.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you tell us about the 3 classes the player gets to play as and the gameplay difference between them?**

**Siavash Tazari:** The basic idea behind having these three classes is to provide totally different gameplay experiences, even when playing the same levels. In a nutshell, the fighter’s main attraction is its ability to copy enemy attacks; the survivor dares you to put yourself in dangerous situations without being able to attack yourself; and the trickster is about eliminating enemies using risky manoeuvres instead of just pressing a fire button.

**Small Dev Talk: A very unique feature of Quick Slick Deadly is the switch between the side scrolling view and the top view. How does that work in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** When you start developing a scrolling shooter, you usually face the question “Is it going to be horizontal or vertical?”. Because of the widescreen nature of most home displays of today, the obvious choice would be to make it horizontal. However, I thought to myself, even when making a horizontal scrolling shooter, both side view and top view could be implemented. So, that’s what I tried to do in Quick Slick Deadly. This switching between views has provided a few interesting possibilities. For example, in one section in the top view, you encounter enemies that are attached to a bridge below you. Had this happened in the side view, and then all these enemies had to be positioned on a straight line. The top view enables giving these enemies different positions on the bridge. Furthermore, the switching between views provides some visual surprises. It also affects how each playable class is handled. For example, in the side view, it appears that the fighter has only one cannon, even though it has a primary and secondary attack. But when the view switches to the top, you see that it actually has two separate cannons, one firing the primary and the other one firing the secondary attack; and that has a great impact on how you control the fighter in the top view.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the boss battles like in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** Quick Slick Deadly, in its current state, is a small game that is sold at a very low price and justifies its value mostly by offering high replay value and lots of experimentation possibilities. As a trade-off, there are currently not that many levels, and thus, not that many bosses in the game. I rather leave what is included to be explored by the players than to spoil it here; but I can say that this version of the game serves more as an appetizer. Whether there will be a main dish or not depends on how many people will hunger for more after having the appetizer. :)

**Small Dev Talk: What type of game modes are there in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** There’s only single player and it is not divided into several modes. But, as you already know, you have the three classes to play with; and also, you essentially have two ways to take on a mission: Either go for a high score or go for a fast time. Although, your time does greatly influence your score. But still, going for the fastest time possible requires a totally different approach than going for the highest score possible.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the environments like in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** Currently, Quick Slick Deadly is completely sci-fi-themed, but if any expansions are to be developed, you can expect very different themes for future environments. This is actually something that has also been tried to be expressed through the “Adventurous Productions” logo: I like a video game to take the player to a lot of different places, with unique level design elements for each new environment. Unfortunately, Quick Slick Deadly has been created within such limiting circumstances, that achieving this ideal has not been possible yet. I just hope for enough support from the gamers out there to enable “Adventurous Productions” to become a bigger team and work on bigger projects.

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any player progression or upgradable features in Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** As far as progression is concerned, the player starts playing as the fighter first and will unlock the survivor after playing five tutorial missions. In the same manner, the trickster can be unlocked by playing five tutorial missions with the survivor. I wanted the player to get to know each of these classes in exactly this order, because otherwise, the process of learning the game could have become quite confusing. Then, as mentioned before, there is a reward to unlock by finishing all missions with all three classes. Upgrades in the sense of permanent benefits as you progress through the game are not available. But within each mission, you have the possibility to increase the level of your boost ability to be able to go at faster speeds, and also the level of your power, which has different effects on different classes. The fighter benefits from a higher area of effect for its primary weapon when reaching each next power level, while for the trickster, the active time for using its boomerang increases, which could both be good and bad, but then again, combining great power with great risk makes up the entire philosophy behind the trickster’s gameplay. Playing as the trickster is by far the most challenging.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any planned updates for Quick Slick Deadly? Any upcoming expansions or new features?**

**Siavash Tazari:** When you play through Quick Slick Deadly, you definitely realize that this game was made with a bigger scope in mind. I sure hope that players will want to see expansions for the game. But whether really Quick Slick Deadly will be expanded upon or not, very much depends on the success of the current version. There may even be the possibility of developing a remake with higher standards, if our team manages to grow bigger.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** To answer this, I need to tell you a bit about my background. I have studied computer games design at the University of Teesside in England. During my studies, I created several game and level concepts. Since I’m most passionate about action-adventure games and platformers, most of my designs were for 3D action-adventures, but Quick Slick Deadly is actually also originally one of my university works. It came to be in a time when I was familiarizing myself a bit more with the scrolling shooter genre. I though about how well one could combine this genre with the action-RPG genre. At the same time, back then, I was quite active in competing in various “Sonic the Hedgehog” games for best time, score, or ring counts, submitting my records on a website called soniccenter.org. So, this also made me think about how the scrolling speed of scrolling shooters is fixed by default and doesn’t allow time trials, even though the scrolling shooter is a highly competitive genre. So, I designed Quick Slick Deadly with the intent of addressing these aspects. After my studies, I managed to work for a few game companies in Germany. One of the more important roles that I had was beeing the level designer for most of the downloadable content levels for the puzzle game “Demolition Inc.” by Zeroscale Entertainment. But anyway, at some point, I wanted to try my chance at developing my own game. More than anything, I would have liked to develop an action adventure game, but because of the circumstances I was in, I was unable to take the time to design a game from the ground up and most concepts for action adventure games that I created in the past were with a big 3D scale in mind. I wanted to develop a game on my own, using the game authoring tool “Multimedia Fusion 2”, with only graphical support from my lovely wife “Mahsa”. So, the best concept that I could have picked to work with within those circumstances, was Quick Slick Deadly.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** What I really like about it is how very different the game plays with each of the classes. Furthermore, I think that the amount of experimentation possibilities that it offers is awesome. The fighter can obtain up to seven different secondary weapons within one level, which is a big deal for the sake of experimenting and replay value. Even when playing with the other two classes, there are important choices to make. As the trickster, it is critical to figure out how high you would like your power level to go; or as the survivor, when to use your power to activate your shield and when to save power for a powerful attack. Figuring out when to use the boost ability is also extremely important, even when only aiming for the best possible score. Speedrunning is, again, a story of its own. If, in the future, there are going to be videos of Quick Slick Deadly on the internet, played by dedicated gamers, you may very well see that each player has taken a very different approach.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the developer of Quick Slick Deadly?**

**Siavash Tazari:** As mentioned, Mahsa did almost all the graphics, while I did everything else. Before I continue, I would like to use this opportunity to thank her again for the great support that she provided to me through the development of Quick Slick Deadly. Without her help, our game could never have existed. :) The biggest challenge for me was actually programming the game within the “Multimedia Fusion 2” environment, because I have no real programming background. It was very important to me to make Quick Slick Deadly technically as error free as possible. At some points I got so desperately frustrated, because problems occurred that I had no idea how they came to be and how I must solve them. In these situations, the awesome ClickTeam community was a great help, but many times, even the community could not help me and it took me several weeks to find a solution for a problem. But the amazing thing is that, even when I sometimes could not believe how I possibly could work around a serious problem, at the end, I always managed to find a way. It has been essential for me to never give up and to always press on by holding on to my vision of my desired future.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed that Quick Slick Deadly is already available on Desura. What have you learned in the development of Quick Slick Deadly and what advice would you give to upcoming developers?**

**Siavash Tazari:** By the time I started to look for ways of distributing Quick Slick Deadly, I realized that the biggest mistake that I made was to develop Quick Slick Deadly in secrecy. What I encourage other developers to do, and what I sure will do myself for my next project, is to get the world to know about your project as soon as possible. Whether through crowd funding websites, indie development websites like IndieDB, or putting an early version of your project on Steam Greenlight, it is very important to familiarize people with your game way ahead of its release.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed that Quick Slick Deadly is on Steam Greenlight. If your game becomes Greenlit, will you take advantage of Steam’s great features such as Steam Workshop, Big Picture, Inventory, Achievements or Trading Cards?**

**Siavash Tazari:** Currently, there are no plans to use any of these features for Quick Slick Deadly.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Siavash Tazari:** Dear readers, I very much hope that you guys will give Quick Slick Deadly a chance. On the surface, it may not seem to provide the standards that are usually expected from games of today, but there is much more to this game than it may appear at the first glimpse. Quick Slick Deadly is also only a starting point for much bigger intensions. I would like to give to you games that combine clever, exploration-based level design with a gradually challenging and constantly varied gameplay, packaged in an unforgettable journey of site-seeing and adventure, the way that has become oh so rare these days. Quick Slick Deadly, in its current state, may not entirely be the embodiment of this game development philosophy, but I hope you will see its huge potential through the lots of experimentation possibilities that it provides and enable me to build on the experience that I have gained so far to deliver games via a bigger team that get step by step closer to excellence. Only through your support will “Adventurous Productions” be able to become the game development company that it aims to be. :)
