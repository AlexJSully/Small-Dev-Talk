Join along Kade in Hameed Catel’s new afrocentric graphic novel, Champion of Dema. Recently, I got the chance to talk with Hameed Catel from Kiru Comics on his new graphic novel, Champion of Dema. You can support him on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1088749339/champion-of-dema) and find out more on his [website](https://ronucreative.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** Champion of Dema is a one-shot, 70 page Afrocentric Graphic Novel

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** Champion of Dema more or less revolves around the main character Kade.

Every ten years an individual from the village of Dema is randomly and magically chosen to possess spiritual powers. Kade is a young reluctant man who has just recently been chosen to harbour these powers for the next ten years. He is constantly badgered by the citizens of his village to use his powers to uphold justice, defend them against the Soul-takers and in short be their champion. But he has no intentions of doing that, he just wants to be left alone to continue enjoying his life. He enjoys the celebrity that comes with being a Champion but doesn’t want the responsibility.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will we see in Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** All kinds, I don’t know if you realise this but even the cast are all different races, Kade is black, Nia is Latina, Zetta is Caucasian, Gobe is middle eastern, Batam and his sister Siani are both Filipino/Malaysian. I try to include a large mixture of races and characters in the short story to show a world where none of that mattered and no one acknowledged it. Also all my characters have something in common; they all have some sort of inner strength, by that I mean none of them are weak minded. Even the weak ones have a hidden strength that comes out if pushed too far.

**Small Dev Talk: What is Kade like and what inspired you to write this character?**

**Hameed Catel:** Lol Kade… ? Well Kade is a confusing young man. He appears confident and sure about himself but inside he’s actually very unsure, he battles with his conscience often but no one on the outside would know that. He really wants to keep up the appearance of being a ruthless non caring guy, basically he wants to appear as a villain so he will be left alone. The only problem is he’s not really villain material, he pretends to cherish material things but he really doesn’t; for example he loves making money but he’s the type that would give it all to a stranger on a whim and just try to make more. However he is incredibly lazy, that’s one thing that he’s not faking or pretending and everyone in the village of Dema knows him for that.

As to what inspired me to write him, well ever since I can remember I have created stories in my head and developed in depth characters. Kade was one of my oldest and most favourite. In the stories I dreamed up, I constantly used him as the guy that would be kind of a villain and then at the last minute help the good guys out. Then after reading the Wheel of Time series and discovering Matrim Cauthon, I realised that Kade was my version of Matt and I wanted to show the world my Matrim Cauthon. That’s where the broad hat and quarter staff came from, from Matrim Cauthon.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed Kade has a panda tattoo on his neck, what does that have to do with his character?**

**Hameed Catel:** The tattoo actually has very little to do with his personality. It is the mark of the champion, every ten years that mark transfers from the previous Champion to the new one. That is how the people of Dema know who to call Champion next. Kade’s mark is on his neck which is why he always wears a shirt that has a collar, so that he can cover it and go unnoticed but it rarely works out for him.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the Soul-takers and what are they like?**

**Hameed Catel:** The Soul-takers are exactly what their names suggest. They’re spiritual beings that feed on the souls of humans and any living animal. When a human is taken by a soul taker, there’s no saving him or bringing him back. That person becomes part of the walking dead… many in the village consider it a fate even worse than death, so many will take their own life before letting a Soul-taker catch them.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to write Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** Believe it or not, Kade did. Like I said Kade has starred in many of my old short stories acting as the wannabe rebel and villain. I decided it was time he had his own story. Also I wanted to do a story where the person with the powers didn’t suddenly accept their role as the hero and just lived up to expectations. Instead I wanted the hero to try and escape his role. So the main challenge would become trying to get him to accept his duty instead of trying to beat the bad guys.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you intend to bring any meaning or moral from Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** The way I see it, a story is pointless without delivering some sort of message, lesson or moral. So yes, this graphic novel has its morals which I believe anyone can relate to. I just don’t want to spit it out though, it would be better to see if the readers got the message on their own.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of challenges did you and your team face in the creation of Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** One of the main one that comes to mind straight away is the slang. Like I said this is to be an Afrocentric graphic novel so I had this idea of the street slang in Dema being pidgin. Pidgin is a form of broken English used in a lot of African countries, although they vary slightly depending on which country you’re in. The problem with that was, anyone that wasn’t familiar with pidgin had trouble reading the slang and consequently got frustrated. I don’t want that to happen to the readers, I want them to enjoy the reading experience so to solve the problem; we’ve decided to have two versions when the book is complete. The first is that with plain straightforward English and the second will be a version which has pidgin in some parts with a glossary to help those new to it along.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you ever plan on making Champion of Dema into a movie, TV series or a game?**

**Hameed Catel:** Woooow! I would absolutely love for this project to go that far and call me a dreamer but I’ve made contingency plans just in case ;) . If the interest and reception is great enough then yes I am fully ready to take it to the animation level or the big screen. Even if it’s just that people like this one so much that they want another one, then I have plans for that too. It all depends on the success of this first book.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Champion of Dema?**

**Hameed Catel:** My favourite aspect would have to be the village of Dema itself, the fact that it contains every human race you can think off living harmoniously together is something I really wanted to have. Also the fact that all those races are wearing African type clothing is another thing that I wanted to have. I’ve read a lot of fantasy novels in which you can lose yourself in rich, magical, worlds with unusual customs, culture and fashion. So I thought why not base my fantasy world on the customs, cultures and fashion of people that I know well, my people.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming graphic artists and writers?**

**Hameed Catel:** For artist all I can say is keep practicing and requesting feedback as I myself am not an artist but I know that advice stands strong for them. For writers it’s more or less the same, you will only get better with practice and constant constructive criticism. However if you’re aiming to be a comic writer, the route I took was to take the TV series and film that I really liked and study the scripts to see how a good script is properly written. I also read a lot of novels so I learn from them too. All in all the best advice I can give to both artists and writers is DON’T BE AFRAID TO DO and NEVER GIVE UP!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Champion of Dema and where can we find it? Can we find it both online and in stores? Also, how much will it cost?**

**Hameed Catel:** The expected release date will be sometime in February, it could be earlier or later. I will be sure to keep my fans updated through my many social media channels lol (I have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/Kirucomics), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kirucomics), [blog](http://kirucomics.blogspot.com/), [tumblr](http://kirucomics.tumblr.com/) and a [website](https://ronucreative.com/)). When it comes out, it will available to buy in both Ebook and hard-copy format. You will be able to buy both of my website and amazon. I’m also looking into using other avenues to make the purchasing easier for those without amazon accounts but I will update on the progress of that as time goes on. Also I will be at various UK conventions so the UK fans can buy a copy off me there. I plan to put part of the book out for free on manga & comic reading websites such as Manga Magazine and the like. It would only be the first 10 pages or something, just to tease the people. The eBook will cost somewhere around £5-£6 and the hard-copy will be about £10-£12? (70 page is a lot of pages)

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Hameed Catel:** I Just want to say thank you all for taking the time to read this interview and Small Dev Talks are awesome people. It would mean the world to me if you guys helped me out with my dream by bringing this project to life.

I just need your help to build this tower of success, without you guys, I really can’t achieve my goal and that’s the honest truth.
