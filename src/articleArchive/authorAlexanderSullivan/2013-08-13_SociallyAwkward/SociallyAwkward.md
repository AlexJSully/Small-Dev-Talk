Am I just too Socially Awkward? Well, why don’t you check out Sam Maiden’s, from Vantage Comics, new art book of his collection of illustrations about anxiety, depression and rejection and how people cope with these problems. You can support his book on his [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vantagecomics/socially-awkward)


Small Dev Talk: What is Socially Awkward?

Sam Maiden: Socially awkward is a collection of illustrations that I started around June of 2013. It’s all about anxiety, depression and rejection and how people cope with these problems. Instead of making serious illustrations I’ve attempted to look at it in a lighter way. I like to think of it as my own illustrative diary as 99% of the drawings in the book have been inspired by REAL events or situations I’ve been in.

Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose this art style for Socially Awkward? 

Sam Maiden: I felt like the serious, artistic approach to this subject was not the way I wanted to go. After all, the majority of people who have these problems tend to be the more creative, free thinking types, so making diagrams and boring art would not appeal to them, it wouldn’t appeal to me, that is how I saw it. So I adapted and developed this cartoony style to represent the subject, taking great inspiration from shows on Cartoon network and styles that are simplified for the purpose of cheap animation. Maybe it has a connection with a childhood too?

Small Dev Talk: Will there be a story in your Socially Awkward art book or will it just be the art?

Sam Maiden: It’s just art, although the book isn’t yet complete (At this moment it’s only about half way done) I am thinking of creating some comic panels, Garfield style, and single line stories. Just, less lasagne.

Small Dev Talk: How long have you been working on Socially Awkward? 

Sam Maiden: I started work on the project at the beginning of June. I’d been laid off work multiple times and my drawing tablet was just sat next to my PC so I decided to crack on with some work and started this project, almost accidentally.

Small Dev Talk: Are you trying to bring any moral or meaning from the Socially Awkward art book?

Sam Maiden: I hope so. There’s definitely no hidden agenda or story behind my works. If anything I’d just like for someone in the same boat as me to see the images and relate to them. To get that feeling when you see or read something, or hear a song and you think ‘Hey, that’s me!’. I guess it makes you feel less alone when you know people are experiencing the same things as you, especially when it has to do with anxiety and depression where you might feel the most alone.

Small Dev Talk: A unique thing I see that you are doing on your Kickstarter is giving an option of being a caricatures, having your backers be drawn and imported into your art book, Socially Awkward. How is that going so far? 

Sam Maiden: I had no idea how the 'Caricature reward’ would be taken but people love it! I’ve had emails already asking when people can start sending me their images. It’s a really fun little side project for the art book to adopt. The art book is all about people so it makes sense to have people in it.

Samll Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Socially Awkward?

Sam Maiden: Nothing really inspired me, I suppose it was accidental. I started drawing things that were happening in my life, although they seemed depressing the images were quite fun, colorful and decorative. It just went from there really.

Samll Dev Talk: What started you as an artist and what challenges have you came across in art? 

Sam Maiden: I started doing art since I was very young, I remember when I was really young, less than 10 maybe? And I created a little comic book and I used to make stop animation videos on my Grandma’s home video camera with my action figures, so I guess I’ve always wanted to create. Then I did art at college and followed it through at University. Since then I’ve just been motivated to creating, either producing other artists or working on my own stuff.

Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming artists and writers?

Sam Maiden: To not stop! If you have a style or an idea YOU believe is interesting or in demand, then the chances are there are going to be others who want to see it. If you enjoy doing what you’re doing then just keep going, don’t put it aside for a few years, make it your passion. I suppose I can’t really say anything that hasn’t already been said.

Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Socially Awkward and how much will it cost? 

Sam Maiden: It will be complete within the next few months and will be posted out to the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vantagecomics/socially-awkward) backers in January! I have no idea if people would still be interested in purchasing it after the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vantagecomics/socially-awkward) date, if they are then it will be for sale on [vantagecomics.co.uk](http://vantagecomics.co.uk/)! But we’ll see.
