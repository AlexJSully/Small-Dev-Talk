It is time for you to become a warlord! Not long ago I got the chance to talk with Alen Magdic from Simos Games on their upcoming game Warlords, a new tablet and mobile strategy game. You can find more about the game at [http://simosgames.com/](http://simosgames.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Warlords?**

**Alen Magdic:** Warlords RTS: Clash of Thrones is tablet & mobile strategy game, set in fantasy world of Aldfarne.

On your journey to defeat fierce evil hordes, you’ll face various challenges which you can solve by applying your own tactics & strategies. You should choose your army carefully, since each unit has very different abilities.

By using a unique unit control and camp upgrades, you will be able to boost your warlord & army at each level. Watch out for treasure chests on the battlefield and be sure to use your magic wisely!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story of Aldfarne?**

**Alen Magdic:** There is quite deep story and lore behind World of Aldfarne. We’re keeping it as surprise for the community and complete lore will be released soon on our website. Here is small spoiler what Thrones are about.

Throne is an expression for influence, sometimes referring to the sole strength of single men, sometimes referring to the declared dominion of House or Guild, or in other occasions, referred to cities or kingdoms, and where power is held, sovereignty upon ways of life is established – the war, trading and culture fall under its throne, and such throne represents controlled land, and such throne is well recognized. Ilsenthar is the strongest throne known in the Aldfarne, but any prospering conqueror would attempt to enslave the sovereignty of elven Houses, or break into the throne of dwarven Styrgard, capital of their culture. In Aldfarne, the power of throne begins with one’s personage and the firm integrity of their actions, whether it be a single person or Guild.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the gameplay like in Warlords?**

**Alen Magdic:** As this is strategy game, we wanted to make as good strategy RTS as possible specific for tablet & mobile environment. Gameplay is simple to learn, with lot of different areas to master with time!

You can combine your different tactics and strategies to win different levels. Throughout our alpha testing phase, we managed to get lot of valuable feedback from players that helped us tweak the gameplay.

We’re most proud that in our testing kids 6-10, teenagers and 20-45 years old, find this game fun to play and very addicting.

Through testing, players had a lot of fun with randomly generated items to power up your Warlord. Higher the level you play item dropped in treasure chest get stronger!

**Small Dev Talk: What are Warlords?**

**Alen Magdic:** Warlords are fighters who earned their respect by bringing their side to triumph in darkest of situations, and though not all choose to be soldiers, their fate leads them to become ones. They are reflection of their throne, and once chosen as Warlords, they bound their purpose to the cause of their throne. In battle, the strength of Warlord is determined by its throne, a title that replaced the idea of leadership, and, in their own ways, they build their personage, until becoming war idols.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of Warlords will the player get to choose from? What are the differences in them?**

**Alen Magdic:** There are 4 different Warlords to start. Ranger, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard. As you can imagine, primarily they are different by races, classes and weapons they use. Also they have very different special abilities, which lead us to totally different gameplay and tactics depending which Warlord you choose!

**Small Dev Talk: What type of spells will the player get to use in Warlords?**

**Alen Magdic:** We divide magic in 3 different categories, offensive, supportive and battlefield. Fireball is offensive, and it has its range of effect. Supportive magic is Healing and similar spells that affect your units for certain time. Battlefield spells will affect all enemy units. As they will be quite powerful, they will also be quite rare.

On Warlords’ website, it says that there will be more than 50 different levels, what will these levels be like?

Each level is its own challenge. Your goal can be quite different, defeating certain units, bosses, towers, surviving for certain time or defeat the level in certain time. I can promise you lots of fun!

**Small Dev Talk: When the game is in full release, will the community still be able to use the level editor to create and play on their own levels?**

**Alen Magdic:** We already created level editor, and we plan to include the best levels from the community in our final release! Come to our forum [warlordsrts.lefora.com](warlordsrts.lefora.com) and checkout PC level editor!

**Small Dev Talk: Does or will this game have any multiplayer?**

**Alen Magdic:** In first release game will be single player. We’re considering making multiplayer modes in future release in players and community show interest.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Alen Magdic:** What I really like about the game is that I've replayed each level more than 100 times, and still i have fun playing the game! Reason for that is that you can take different lines in upgrading your units, using items differently which allows you to try different tactics and strategies to defeat levels.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team face in the development of Warlords?**

**Alen Magdic:** When we started this project, our primary objective was to create a GREAT gameplay. For this reason we started prototyping very early on. As initial gameplay concept wasn’t accepted too well by testers, we had to start from scratch few times. But it was well worth it!

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does Warlords run on?**

**Alen Magdic:** We choose Unity, so we can release easily on multiple platforms.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Warlords and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Alen Magdic:** We’re now in process of pitching the game to publishers, so we can’t say exact launch date. We won’t release until we have really well polished product. It’ll be 2013 for sure, as it’s almost certain that game will be Free to Play.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Alen Magdic:** Please try the game throughout public BETA, and provide us your valuable feedback. Game is already available to download on Google Play Store. Also join our forum to get access to PC version with level editor. We’ll listen to all your ideas and be sure you’ll see the best ideas & levels implemented in the final release of Warlords RTS: Clash of Thrones!
