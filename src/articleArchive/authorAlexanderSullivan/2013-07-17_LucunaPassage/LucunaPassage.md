Can you survive on Mars, the orange planet? Well, try it out on Lacuna Passage, an survival exploration game based on Mars to recover and discover what happened to the first ever manned mission to mars. Recently, I got the chance to talk with Tyler Owen from Random Seed Games about their upcoming and innovative game, Lacuna Passage. You can check out their game on their [website](https://www.lacunapassage.com/) or support them on [Steam Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=156439230) and [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage?ref=card).

Small Dev Talk: What is Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: Lacuna Passage is an exploration and survival game set on Mars that uses actual satellite data to form the terrain.

Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: You play as Jessica Rainer, the only survivor of the crashed Heracles mission, investigating the disappearance of the first ever manned mission to Mars. You will need to uncover mission logs, recorded audio files, and other physical clues left behind at critical mission locations in order to uncover the story.

Small Dev Talk: What time period is Lacuna Passage based during?

Tyler Owen: It takes place in an optimistic future where we are sending multiple science missions to Mars in the late 2020s. Much of the timeline is based on projected proposals for real Mars missions.

Small Dev Talk: What is the main character, Jessica Rainer, like and what inspired you to create this character? What is Jessica’s story?

Tyler Owen: Jessica is a reluctant survivor. She’s strong willed, but she never expected to find herself in the position of being stranded on Mars. A sense of wonder and a desire to explore brought her to where she is and now she has to face a harsh reality. Throughout the game you will discover details about her past that reveal what inspires her and pushes her to keep on living.

Small Dev Talk: Will the environmental events, such as dust storms and dust devils, be random or triggered?

Tyler Owen: A little of both. There will definitely be randomly triggered events to make multiple playthroughs more variable, but a few events will be story-specific.

Small Dev Talk: How is the player supposed to be able to gain or find new oxygen, food or water in Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: Prior to your arrival on Mars there have been several unmanned missions to the planet that delivered the habitats and other supplies. These locations are spread out around the environment at critical research areas. You will have to move between these sites occasionally to maintain your supplies.

Small Dev Talk: How will the nutritional values and overall health affect the gameplay for the player? What happens when the player becomes unhealthy or consumes too much calories?

Tyler Owen: We hope to have the nutrition affect you exactly as you would expect. Being malnourished will definitely cause you noticeable physical changes. You won’t be able to run as far or as fast. Your breathing will be more labored. Ultimately you will become so famished that you will pass out and die. It’s about demonstrating the real risks of space exploration.

Small Dev Talk: In your [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage?ref=card) trailer, you mention that you will be using images and data from the Curiosity in your game. How preciously are you basing your game off of these data?

Tyler Owen: The data we are using comes from the Mars High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). It allows us to recreate the terrain of Mars to an incredible degree of accuracy. In essence, you will be walking around on a version of Mars that is as close as you will get to doing the real thing.

Small Dev Talk: Is Lacuna Passage open world or will it be linear?

Tyler Owen: It will be completely open-world, not only in exploration, but also in narrative. You will be able to fill in different parts of the story depending on the clues you discover. It’s like finding as many pieces of a puzzle as you can to help you understand the picture it forms when completed.

Small Dev Talk: What will the player be able to do in the open world exploration of Mars?

Tyler Owen: The exploration is based around this concept of contextual storytelling. Everything you find is important to the location it was found in and will likely lead you to your next clue at another location. It’s like a trail of breadcrumbs. You can stray from the trail if you like, but you are much less likely to find anything of interest. Blind exploration should be a measure of last resort, though you never know what you might stumble upon.

Small Dev Talk: I noticed on your Random Seed Games’ blog that Lacuna Passage is planning on being Oculus Rift compatible. How is that going for you and your team? What is it like to develop a game for Oculus Rift? How will Lacuna Passage run on Oculus Rift?

Tyler Owen: We are hoping to support a truly immersive experience on the Rift, but we were not able to preorder one until just recently. It should arrive soon and we will begin working on support immediately. The Rift as a device is very exciting for us so we can’t wait to get it working. I think it will definitely help you embody your role as an astronaut.

Small Dev Talk: A lot of science fiction games and movies are not very scientifically accurate. How accurate will Lacuna Passage be scientifically and how are you going about doing this?

Tyler Owen: Our primary goal is to tell a compelling story, but we believe one of the easiest ways to do that is to stay within the boundaries of reality as often as possible. By being scientifically accurate we don’t have to rely on a suspension of disbelief. If we make a scientific claim in the narrative we want the player to be able to look that up and research that claim. If we prove ourselves to be accurate then the player is going to trust us more when we take them through our story. We have consultants on the project who are actual aerospace engineers and space scientist who are helping us to achieve our scientific accuracy.

Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: The landing of the Curiosity rover had a huge effect on me personally. I really want to know what it would feel like to set foot on another world and I hope that Lacuna Passage will help people experience that virtually.

Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: I’m particularly proud of the photography elements that allow you to take snapshots of anything at any time. It is a way to document all the clues you find, or if you prefer, you can simply practice your amateur photography composition skills by taking beautiful landscape shots. All photos are also saved to your harddrive with a filename string that references the time and location in the game where you took the photo, allowing you to easily share your discoveries with your friends and other players.

Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Lacuna Passage?

Tyler Owen: Our biggest challenge has been overcoming the pitfalls of part-time development. We are all currently just volunteers and hobbyists working on the game in our free time. We really hope that the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage?ref=card) funding will come through and allow us to devote the resources we need to complete the game.

Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming developers?

Tyler Owen: The best advice I have ever gotten is to just keep making games. There is literally nothing stopping you. There are so many free tools out there that almost anyone can get started on their own and get real experience. Your portfolio will be infinitely more valuable than your resume.

Small Dev Talk: I noticed that Lacuna Passage is on Steam [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=156439230). If your game becomes Greenlit, will you take advantage of Steam’s great features such as Steam Workshop, Big Picture, Inventory or Trading Cards?

Tyler Owen: We would love to! Steam is such an amazing platform for connecting with your players in new ways. If we can get on Steam then we would love to take advantage of every avenue available to us.

Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Lacuna Passage and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?

Tyler Owen: We hope to release at the end of 2014. We don’t know for certain what the release price will be, but the Digital Download copy on our Kickstarter page is currently only $15.

Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?

Tyler Owen: If you want to see a game like this then we need your help. Support us on Kickstarter! [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage)
