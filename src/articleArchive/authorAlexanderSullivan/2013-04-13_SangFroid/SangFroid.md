With the recent release of Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewvoles, I got the chance to talk to with the developers from Artifice Studio of this amazing Steam Greenlight game and ask them questions about Sang-Froid – Tales of Werwolves. The game’s official website is [http://www.sangfroidgame.com/](http://www.sangfroidgame.com/) but you can purchase the game today on Steam for $14.99 [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/227220/SangFroid__Tales_of_Werewolves/). 

**Small Dev Talk: What is Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves?**

**Artifice Studio:** The game is a unique blend of strategy and action that takes place in a legendary universe set in 19th century Canada. You can look at it as a Tower-Defense Strategy 3rd-person action/RPG mix with a strong storyline. Our team, a crew of 6, has worked on it for the last 3 and a half years. We were Greenlight by the Steam community last November.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves?**

**Artifice Studio:** You play the role of one of the 2 O'Carroll brothers, sons of an Irish immigrant and an Amerindian priestess, trying to defend your sister Joséphine, who has been cursed by the devil himself, and sends hordes of Werewolves to attack your house each night. As if this was not enough, Joséphine inherited some magical powers from her mother and, while in some sort of coma, she prophesizes that an “Invisible Beast” will soon come and destroy the whole region.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story behind Jacky, Josy and Josephine? What inspired the creation of these characters?**

**Artifice Studio:** Jos and Jack are very different and do not get along very well. When he was young, Jos injured himself and his mother used some magic on him. Afterwards he became incredibly big and strong. He’s quite light-hearted and spent most of his life working for lumber companies in the region of Wolvesvale in Eastern Canada (actual province of Québec).

His older brother Jack, on the other hand, is way more of an idealist and he participated in the “Patriotes” rebellion of 1839 to claim “a Responsible Government” from the British authorities. Since then, he had to live clandestinely, so he built himself a cabin in a forest close to the village of Wolvesvale.

The 2 brothers have to set aside their differences when Jos comes to Jack’s cabin with their sister Joséphine. She had been accused by the priest (and all the citizens) of Wolvesvale for having set the village church on fire.

Our characters were inspired by many Canadian folktales. Jos in particular was inspired by the great Jos Montferrand, a historical French-Canadian hero.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of environments will be included in Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves? Are the surroundings around the cabin and church the only map or will there be more?**

**Artifice Studio:** The game is mainly set in the forest around Jack’s cabin. It includes 5 buildings to defend (you start with 2) and it expands as the game progresses. It was important for us to keep the same environment to help build the feeling of “a home fortress”. The more you play, the more the you know your forest. Learning where it is best to set a specific trap, where it is best to escape, etc. On the other hand, it was important for us to prevent our environment from becoming boring over time and we solved that issue by having lumberjacks from the nearby lumber company come and hack trees each night, thus creating new paths all the time. Water along the river may also freeze over from time to time, allowing passage where it was impossible before.

In addition to that, players can visit the town of Wolvesvale and the Indian village of Mashteuiatch to buy many useful items/services.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose to create a story based off of supernatural creatures? Especially the Windigo which has not many appearances in TV shows movies or video games.**

**Artifice Studio:** We wanted to create a universe that was a blend between real History and folklore. We think the historical bits give credibility and then, once the player suspends his disbelief, we like to surprise him with folklore and magic.

There is also a difference between folklore and fantasy. All our creatures were inspired from legends that were actually told to kids and adults a hundred years ago or so, rather than being totally invented or inspired by Tolkien, D&D or videogames. We think that adds to the uniqueness and richness of our game.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the gameplay like in Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves?**

**Artifice Studio:** The gameplay is divided in 2 phases, day and night. During the day, you analyze the prophecies of Joséphine and prepare to defend your buildings and forest by laying traps. You are encouraged to combine different traps together to produce better effects (e.g. you combine a bait and a net trap to lure werewolves). You can also go to the village to buy items such as guns, axes and whiskey. You can even bless bullets and weapons to increase their efficiency against particular creatures. Finally, there’s a skill tree in which you can buy special “powers” to increase the efficiency of your traps or your aptitude in combat.

Then, night comes and you must execute the plan you thought out during the day. In Sang-Froid, most creatures are stronger than you, so you need to set up ambushes and play wisely if you wish to survive. This is no mindless hack & slash! Things rarely works exactly like you predicted however, and there’s always room for improvisation.

One of your best aids in combat is intimidation. Werewolves and other creature can be frightened with fire, by shouting, or by attacking them. Intimidating your opponents prevents them from attacking you all at once and a lot of fights are won on the psychological level. However, when in packs, creatures tend to be more courageous and THEY start to intimidate you!

**Small Dev Talk: Can you describe to us how the traps work in Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves? Is there a maximum to many traps you can place? If a trap is not used, will it remain there for the next night?**

**Artifice Studio:** 2 things limit the amount of traps you can lay: time and money. As I said, creatures attack each night, so you have to work fast. Fortunately, as the game progresses, some “allies” come to help you laying the traps, thus allowing you to become more time-efficient. On the money side, some traps are free (like Bait from your own barn, or Bonfires), while some others cost money (like Wolf Traps, Ballistae and Mortars). You make money by selling the fur of the creatures you hunt.

It was important for us to give a feeling of “persistence” to the world and so, all the traps that cost you money stay permanently (if unused) once you place them.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of weapons will be included Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves have?**

**Artifice Studio:** 19th century was the time of the decline of old-fashioned muskets and the rise of rifles. All the guns in the game are inspired from historical models and we tried to make them behave in a way that is close to reality. This means that muzzle-loading your gun can take quite a few seconds. So you have to know when it is time to reload and where to place bonfires to intimidate your opponents to give you time to reload when they’re frightened. You can also build Watch-Towers to shoot your opponents from above.

Ammunition also come in 3 types: lead, holy and silver. Each type is more efficient in specific situations.

On the close-combat side, we have 2 main categories: industrial-made lumberjack axes that can be blessed at the local convent and Amerindian weapons such as tomahawks. Again, all the weapons were inspired by historical types and each of them has specific uses against particular creatures.

**Small Dev Talk: Do the weapons have to be blessed after every night?**

**Artifice Studio:** No. Once a weapon is blessed, it is forever. Ammunition, however, is expensed rather quickly and must be bought over and over again.

**Small Dev Talk: How does the player gain money in this game?**

**Artifice Studio:** As I said, by selling the fur of the creatures you hunt during the night. Some creatures yield more than others though… Killing a Windigo, even if it’s a very lethal creature, won’t give you anything as it doesn’t have fur (it’s some sort of a frozen cadaver after all).

**Small Dev Talk: What skills does the skill tree feature? How does the player get skill points to use in the skill tree?**

**Artifice Studio:** After each night, whether you fail or succeed, you get some experience points based on your achievements. The XP in turn allows you to gain levels which give you skill points with which you can buy skills. There are 2 types of skills, trap-oriented and combat-oriented. Examples of trap-oriented skills are: Baiting, which allows you to poison your bait and Faith that increase the effect of your wayside crosses when you pray. Examples of combat-oriented skills are Rage, that gives you special combat moves, and Intimidation that increases your chances to frighten your enemies.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of game modes will be included in Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves? Will there be a multiplayer or co-op mode?**

**Artifice Studio:** We would like to implement a coop mode in the future, but we need to see how the sales go first.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves?**

**Artifice Studio:** We wanted to create a game based on werewolves. It just happens that here, in Québec, we have a long tradition of werewolves in our folktales. They are, however quite different from werewolves we see in modern movies, games or novels. We thought this would be great as it would set our game apart from all the others. Starting from there, we contacted best-selling author and werewolf-specialist Bryan Perro to help us shape our universe in a way that would be faithful to 19th century Canadian folktales. As the game production progressed, our universe became richer and we incorporated many creatures of myth and legends like the Will-o’-the-Wisp and the Windigo.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Artifice Studio:** It’s open-endedness. Nothing makes me happier than when I see someone succeeding a night in a way I never thought of!

**Small Dev talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves?**

**Artifice Studio:** Many. We had no official offices, so I had to convert a part of my house into a studio. We had no external funding so we had to borrow the money on our own. At the beginning of the project, we thought we would be ok with 2 years and it finally took close to 4 years. When we started the project, 4 years ago, we were not aware of Kickstarter and Greenlight was not invented on Steam. So, last August, we had quite a surprise when we learned that we would need to win a kind of “popularity” contest to get on Steam. Finally, this turned out well for us though… ;)

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Artifice Studio:** Persevere!

**Small Dev Talk: What engine is Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves using?**

**Artifice Studio:** Virtools from Dassault.

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like being an indie developer?**

**Artifice Studio:** You’re free and poor. Which is better, I guess, than the opposite.

**Small Dev Talk: Noticing that you will be releasing this game on Steam, will you take advantage of Steam’s Workshop or Big TV? Will Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves have or allow user created content such as maps and/or controller support?**

**Artifice Studio:** Right now, we’re thinking about taking a break after all those long years of overtime. After that, we’ll see depending on the sales. We would LOVE to encourage user-created content! However, we’re fundamentally story-based, so we’ll have to think of something creative to make it work.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Artifice Studio:** We launched on April 5th 2013. It is available on Steam at 14,99$. I think this is a fair deal if you like our type of game. Free-to-play is never entirely true. Games take time and money to make and thus can’t be totally free. I prefer to ask for money upfront and stop considering the game environment as a “store” once the player starts to play. Rest assured that you can put your wallet away when you start playing our game ;).

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Artifice Studio:** Thanks so much for supporting us! We think Sang-Froid is different and our community proves that there is a demand for different games in different settings. I hope this will inspire other developers to create more authentic and unique experiences.
