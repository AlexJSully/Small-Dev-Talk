It’s time for a new adventure with Sarina and Toru in The Realm. Recently, we got the chance to talk with Tom Szirtes from Atomhawk Design who worked on other big name projects such as Dead Island regarding their new game, The Realm. You can find more about the game at <http://www.therealmgame.com/>

**Small Dev Talk: What is The Realm?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The Realm is a new innovative adventure game - an evolution of the point & click graphical adventure.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in The Realm?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The Realm is set in a far distant future when nature has reclaimed the earth, and the age of myth and magic is on the rise once more. Humans remain but live a simpler life off the land. The story follows a girl called Sarina, whose mother falls sick and she must go on a desperate quest to find a cure for her mother - a flower with healing properties. On her journey she comes across Toru, a giant stone golem who has been asleep in the forest for many years and the travel together to a forgotten city.

**Small Dev Talk: How is the gameplay going to work with Sarina and Toru? Do you switch back in forth between characters or do you just play as one character?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Yes you can control both characters separately, each one has their own unique abilities so you need to utilise those in order to solve the puzzles. You can join them up and move them together which allows for even more possibilities.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of puzzles will there be in the game? How difficult will these puzzles be?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The puzzles in The Realm will be most environments based so it will consist of working out how to escape a particular scene. The puzzles will be challenging but not insanely difficult.

**Small Dev Talk: From all the gameplay trailers and images, the environment in the Realm is very beautiful. Why did you choose these environments and what other environments or sceneries will the player come across?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The environment is based on the North East of England where Atomhawk are based, so you can recognise the locations you see in the game, but they are reimagined as abandoned cities overgrown with plants and twisted vines. The main environments are Sarina’s village, the forest and the forgotten city.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be combat in The Realm? If so, how will that work?**

**Tom Szirtes:** No there is no traditional combat in The Realm.

**Small Dev Talk: Will The Realm be a linear game or will it be open world?**

**Tom Szirtes:** It’s a linear narrative driven adventure game.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create The Realm?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The Realm started off as an internal Atomhawk project. Atomhawk do a lot of work for other big game companies like Sony and Microsoft, but they wanted to develop their own IP mostly as fun and as a training exercise. When I met Ron last year at GDC we discussed how this could be developed into a game and it all grew from there.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of The Realm?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The visuals are obviously the standout feature. I personally also love the story and how we show the emotional bond between Sarina and Toru through animation and gameplay. It’s a really special concept.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of The Realm and how did you overcome them?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Our main challenge is funding the game to be honest. I’m sure development will throw up more challenges, but our many years of experience making games should see us through those! That’s all part of the fun of the process

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Unity.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Tom Szirtes:** The best way to learn is to do. Copying can be a good way too. Just get working on something, find some friends and build a project. It doesn’t have to be great the first time, it’s all in the practice.

**Small Dev Talk: Your game uses a stage set technique where the background is layers of backgrounds to create a sense of depth. In the developers prospective, how effect is this method and are there any advantages or disadvantages to using this method?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Yes we combine 3D models with 2D backgrounds using the technique. The advantages are that we don’t have to hand draw all the animation like traditional point & click adventures and but we can still keep a lovely hand drawn feel to the art. The disadvantage is you are limited in terms of camera movement, but it’s fine for this type of game. Also you need to be careful to match lighting cues, shadows in the scene. Oh yes, and the alpha sorting gets a bit intense.

**Small Dev Talk: How is it like to develop a game for all 3 main OS (Window, Mac and Linux)? It there a difficulty difference between the development of each OS?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Luckily Unity handles that for us. It seems to work fairly seamlessly though I’m sure we will find some compatibility issues as we go along. There’s always something.

**Small Dev Talk: Your team has worked on other big name projects such as Dead Island. From those experiences, what have you learned from those experiences and is there anything you will be bringing over from other games that you have developed in the past?**

**Tom Szirtes:** Of course, all experience will be brought to bear. Actually, The Realm is fairly small project compared to what we are used to working on. But that’s nice, as you don’t need such a large team and don’t need to work on the project for 3 years! :)

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for The Realm and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Tom Szirtes:** We would like to launch in Feb 2014. It will be a premium game, free-to-play doesn’t really work well for adventure games.

**Small Dev Talk: If The Realm becomes successfully GreenLit and released on Steam, will you take advantage of Steams great features such as Workshop for custom content or Big TV for controller support?**

**Tom Szirtes:** It will depend on how much time / budget we have left over to implement ‘extra’ features.
