Yesterday I got the chance to have an interview with a member of the Yuki vs Panda team, Graham Misiurak on their hilarious and amazing graphic novel, Yuki vs Panda. A story about a high school teenage girl and her nemesis, the Panda! You check it out here at [http://www.yukivspanda.com/](https://www.yukivspanda.com/) or support it at [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/yuki-vs-panda?c=home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/yuki-vs-panda?c=home)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** Well Yuki vs Panda is essentially the twisted tale of young High Schooler Yuki and her killer Panda Nemesis. Volume 1 in particular is their backstory and the major set up for these characters

**Small Dev Talk: What is the background story to Yuki vs Panda of why the Panda wants to seek revenge on Yuki?**

**Graham Misiurak:** Without giving away too much, Yuki and Panda meet when they are young and it really doesn’t go too well. So bad that Panda is shamed into leaving the zoo he was living in and forced to travel alone seeking self-redemption. Yuki on the other hand has suppressed the entire event and has no clue.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story behind the master?**

**Graham Misiurak:** Master Lee is Yuki’s adoptive Grandfather. He is a major part in the story but that won’t come out until volume 3. For right now he’s basically just a hard-ass on her. Ya see, Yuki has tremendous powers and he has been training her to use them wisely and control her impulsive behaviour.

**Small Dev Talk: Adoptive grandfather? What happened or where are Yuki’s parents?**

**Graham Misiurak:** That’s not really touched on right now but it’s part of the larger story arch between Yuki and Panda. For now no one really knows where they are. Master Lee reveals how he found Yuki in Volume 3 as well.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired the creation of Yuki and her two friends?**

**Graham Misiurak:** I guess they are embodiments of many archetypes found in pop culture and high school life in general. That’s sort of their role. Bernard and Madesin represent contrasting personalities that Yuki can feed off of. Beranrd is crass and a pretty pig-headed chauvinist. While Madesin is a meek and quiet brown mouse who longs to have the confidence of Yuki. They are definitely inspired from anime characters and manga’s. There always seems to be a little rag-tag group of misfits.

**Small Dev Talk: Yuki vs Panda seems to be a comedic comic, what other genres will be included in Yuki vs Panda, such as romance?**

**Graham Misiurak:** Oh ya for sure. It’s really kind of a love story wrapped up in a revenge plot. But we really go back and forth. There has to be serious parts so the comedy will be effective. But also there will be a LOT of fighting in the future episodes. We just didn’t want to skimp on story so it requires some slower pace for character building.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the Panda like in your comic?**

**Graham Misiurak:** We wanted to give both Yuki and Panda a relatable emotion or situation that people could identify with through all the craziness and fun. So Panda is really being set up in volume 1 as a tragic figure. We feel sorry for him, so that when he starts acting crazy and exacting his revenge, we at least can understand him and don’t lose sense of him as someone who can be our hero, or anti-hero.

**Small Dev Talk: What types of things are we expected to see the Panda do in his revenge against Yuki?**

**Graham Misiurak:** We have so many ideas. This is really where we’re going to have some fun! I don’t want to ruin anything but I can say that it will be everything from psychological warfare to physical confrontations. And there will be a lot of blood, sweat and tears by the end.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will the readers get to see in Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** I think we’ve got a pretty interesting bunch of characters. We’ve had a lot of time to think about these characters so we’ll be incorporating everything from everyday people you see in your city, to celebrity cameos (or at least “inspired by”) to more super-natural stuff.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you and your team to write Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** It’s really always just been Nick and myself. We are both major geeks but in different ways but our mutual love for the culture and aesthetic around comics and manga was really what brought us together. While working on my show Dim Sum TV one of our most popular skits was the Yuki vs Panda ones. Something we just intended at first as a sort of cheeky Ranma ½ meets Tom and Jerry. But it caught on and never really let go of our minds either.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of challenges did you and Nick face in the creation and development of Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** We basically had no idea. Everything we’ve done is a learning process, and there has been a LOT of learning! Luckily our artist is a comic-vet so she helps us out when we get too lost. She’s actually our second artist. We were set back almost an entire year because our first artist bailed on us. When that happened…that was almost the end of it right there. But literally I just thought “nah, not gonna’ let this end here like that!”

**Small Dev Talk: Who is your current artist for Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** A.L. Jones is our artist. She’s an amazing, amazing artist. We giggle like school kids every time we see the latest batch of roughs.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you plan on making Yuki vs Panda into an anime or movie in the future?**

**Graham Misiurak:** It’s definitely something we want to do. I plan to develop a pitch for an animation soon when I have some time but nothing in the near future. A video game is another thing we’d love to do. But right now we should really focus on releasing our first issue. =)

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** Digital copies should be available in early April with printed copies available at the end of April.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Yuki vs Panda?**

**Graham Misiurak:** I think what I love most is that there are no boundaries really. We can poke fun at anything and it’s a perfect avenue to express our loves and pet-peeves of both western and eastern clichés and tropes.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Graham Misiurak:** I just really hope they laugh and enjoy it. And truly this is just the starting stride to a really wild story!
