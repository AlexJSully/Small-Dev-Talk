**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Dead Plasma?** 

**Antonie Baker:** The story of Dead Plasma takes place in the future and revolves around the events of the Martial Arts Grand Prix or MAGP for short. Basically, a woman named Yagi Nakagawa becomes the first female contestant to win the tournament and is deemed the “Goddess of Martial Arts”. After winning a few more tournaments she mysteriously disappears. Fast forward years later, a mysterious company called MAIDEN hosts the MAGP and reveals that their chairman is Yagi herself. There is a whole conspiracy going on with MAIDEN and Yagi. I can’t spoil too much though. You’ll just have to play the game when it becomes available to learn the truth.

**Small Dev Talk: Creating a fighting game, how do you plan on making Dead Plasma different from other fighting games such as Tekken and Street Fighter?**

**Antonie Baker:** That’s a tough one. I play Street Fighter casually and play Tekken in local tourneys whenever I get the chance. It’s almost like those franchises have done it all. So I stepped back and said “What haven’t they refined?” “What concepts could be better if revisited?” “What gives these titles lasting appeal?” So I research fighting styles and study the approach of both franchises. I feel what would make Dead Plasma different is what we put into our characters and environments. When people pick up the game I want them to think “Wow, I wonder how this character he would fair against Ryu or Jin Kazama” or know that this experience is only exclusive to Dead Plasma.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters/fighters will get to play as? What will be the gameplay difference in these characters? Does each character have their own fighting style?** 

**Antonie Baker:** Well there are a lot of concepts and styles we are set with and playing around with. For instance the main character Raizo is more of a balanced type. He helps new players get into the swing of things. We have an idea of a wrestler character who rely purely on grapples. I think this was never really touched in 2D fighters. We figured when it comes to strikes he’s good for max 2-3 hits, but when he grabs a hold of you pray that his combo drops. As a counter balance he cannot, however, run towards his opponent but have short dashes. We also studied each martial art and focused on their strengths and weaknesses to try to balance out the game. We wanted it to be a battle of wits, not X character is strong because he is programmed this way and the dev team liked him. We have a wide range of styles like boxing, capoeira, tae-kwon do, freestyle karate, ba gua etc. I think all of the fighting styles, mechanics, and character personalities will draw in their own respected fan bases. Out of the 12 characters I think someone will find a style that is comfortable and provides the unique tools they think they can win with.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of environments will be able to fight in?**

**Antonie Baker:** Well the environments in DP are modern-futuristic. You’ll see some noticeable landmarks and places but we wanted the environments to pop out at the player. The environments will be 3D models akin to the popular series BlazBlue.

**Small Dev Talk: Will the player get to interact with the environment during fights?** 

**Antonie Baker:** Unfortunately no. Our primary focus was to concentrate on competitive play and emphasis on the different fighting styles of each of the characters. However the presentation and detail is sure to immerse players into our universe and more of the character’s surroundings.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you describe to the readers how each game mode is going to work?**

**Antonie Baker:** Certainly. First off we will have the traditional story and training modes for the game. We have an arcade mode which you fight 9 characters (including boss characters) and VS mode. We also threw in time attack mode; where you try to beat the game in record amount of time. We have score attack mode; where you try to beat the game with the highest score possible. We also have a mode called The Lab. It teaches you the core mechanics of the game like movement and parrying and how to do combos. There is a survival mode. You can choose to outlast the cast or take on an endless number of enemies until you get KO'ed. Finally we have a challenge mode. There are 80 challenges and 20 special challenges you have to complete. They get progressively harder too. They range from “preform a 10 hit combo” to “survive a round with 5% heath”. We are going to be really creative with the challenges.

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any plans on including an online competitive play to Dead Plasma?** 

**Antonie Baker:** Yes! Definitely!

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Dead Plasma?**

**Antonie Baker:** M.U.G.E.N inspired me to create a full game. It first started as a hobby, but at the time it was called Blue Knights and the characters and concepts were WAAAY different than what we have now. After I explained my idea to a friend, he just flat out said “Dude, M.U.G.E.N sucks. Nobody will appreciate the hard work you put into it because someone will mod your character and make it kill everything in 1 hit”. After that I was a little discouraged. When Microsoft announced the indie games channel, I had to browse it. I stumbled across a game called Funky Punch XL. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I figured if this person can create this and publish it here I can create a fighting game as well. After that I started writing stories and drew concepts. The rest is history.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favorite aspect of Dead Plasma?** 

**Antonie Baker:** The characters. I love people because they are diverse and interesting and I wanted to add that to the roster of Dead Plasma. I want people to see the diversity of the characters from different creeds and walks of life. I think it will show through the way they act and most importantly, fight.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Dead Plasma?**

**Antonie Baker:** Keeping some of life’s challenges out of the way. I’ve had a couple of times where others on the team and I had personal life situations get in the way of development and the game had to be  put on a hiatus.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming developers?**

**Antonie Baker:** Do what you feel is best. This is a learning process. If you feel what you can do is reachable, then it’s reachable. Be able to take constructive criticism and not get married to your ideas. Make sure that you and your team are passionate about what you want to do. You are creating something that’s bigger than you and your entire team and good or bad, shapes the future of the team and the individuals part of the project.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Dead Plasma and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?** 

**Antonie Baker:** Well our expected date is Spring 2014 for PC and Xbox 360 through the indie games. $14.99 is our pricing point due to the amount of content we are packing. We will explore other platforms too. We also will do fun things like if we get X amount of downloads we will do reduced price or free DLC characters. Time will tell.
