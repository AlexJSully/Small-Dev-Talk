Army Men III, another addition to the Army Men video game series is coming soon and I got the chance to talk with the developer, Franklin Iheanacho from Neotl Empire, about this exciting sequel to Army Men II. You can check out the game here, [http://armymen3.com/](http://armymen3.com/) to see yourself

**Small Dev Talk: What is Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Army Men III is the conclusion to the original Army Men trilogy and the direct successor of the defunct 3DO Company’s best seller Army Men II.

**Small Dev Talk: Does Army Men III have a story and if so, what is it about?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Yes, It takes place where Army Men II left off. 

Since the death of Major Mylar, the Tan Army have begun to lose every battle. Even with the help of the Blue and Grey armies, they’re efforts were futile and the victory of the Green Army seemed imminent. However, the Insane Grey Doctor who was recently declared MIA, is still alive and has been furthering his research that he started back in the tropical zone of the plastic world, going beyond zombies and instead has found a new interest in the insects of the real world. Spawning creature after creature of the vilest order, The Grey Doctor’s power only grows with each passing moment. Seeking to capture and destroy the plastic world, The Doctor finally emerges back in the real world, with his new found army ready and at his command he launches an assault on all of the nations. But unknown to anyone, even the Tan General Plastro, the Grey Doctor has also recovered Major Mylar’s remains and with them, has created a weapon so powerful, it threatens the balance of both the real and the plastic worlds.

**Small Dev Talk: How does the Grey Doctor make his reappearance? And what type of creatures is the Grey Doctor spawning?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Unlike the game’s predecessors where General Plastro was technically the main antagonist, The Grey Doctor is the antagonist of this game.

He makes an appearance towards the final mission. He has created a series of warped and insane experiments including the Zombies from the previous game, genetically-modified insects designed to be even MORE aggressive than they were in the previous game, and his latest experiments, the Machines of War.

**Small Dev Talk: What are these Machines of War? Are these like the brutes of Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** No, The Tan Brutes are basic close-quarters soldiers of the Tan Army, they tend to carry shotguns and sometimes Rocket-Launchers.

The Machines of War on the other hand, are an army of menacing and merciless machines created by the Insane Grey Doctor to obliterate all plastic life.

They are the basic units of the MoW and returning characters from Army Men Sarge’s Heroes 2, however with a totally new origin. In SH2, they were machines found in the Real World by General Plastro, in this game; they were created from alloys of plastic and metal minerals harvested from the Real World.

**Small Dev Talk: What new features will Army Men III have that is different from the first and second?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** For starters, Army Men III will be supporting online cooperative multiplayer - Players will be able to play through the 3-5 hour campaign or the action-packed Skirmish arcade missions with up to 16 friends with an arsenal of over 9 weapons and over 9 vehicles, and the ability to customize your player character for online play. The game will also support User-Mod content - Making custom missions, weapons, vehicles, characters, even going as far as changing the game itself (Total Conversion Mods).

However, Army Men III is online campaign-inspired so aside from the plastic currency scoring system that we also plan to implement, there will not be any competitive multiplayer - Luckily, that is where our standalone expansion, Army Men Multiplayer will come in.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the Skirmish mode like?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** As mentioned previously, the Skirmish mode is practically the arcade mode for Army Men III. So far in the upcoming Beta release (which at the moment only supports single player), it practically plays like a typical Action/Adventure arcade mode with no scoring system. However in the next Beta release, it will include a currency score system, in the form of Plastic (as seen in Army Men RTS). Plastic(P) is required for mostly anything - Reviving allied players and NPCs, buying weapons, ammo, and power-ups via the Purchase Menu or an Item Dispenser (depending on the mission), and of course mission-specific features and certain objectives that may require teamwork (if playing online) in order to complete such mission(s). Did I also forget to mention that there will be large-scale battles and planes in the game?

**Small Dev Talk: What is the plastic currency scoring system?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Plastic currency (P) is a key feature to Army Men III’s cooperative multiplayer mode. As I previously mentioned, it is used for almost anything. Since it serves as the main scoring system, shooter gamers would more-likely assume the obvious - kill enemy targets in order to score. However, there are many other ways to score in some extra plastic besides killing enemies. For instance, depending on the settings, you may either earn or lose 50P for healing or reviving friendly NPC, or 100P for doing the same towards other player. They are also vital for purchasing additional inventory - weapons, ammunition, power-ups, perhaps even to unlock certain shortcuts or secret areas (future Skirmish maps) or enforce defenses (upcoming Survival mode).

**Small Dev Talk: What type of weapons and vehicles will you include in Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** There wasn’t much consistency with the Army Men series weapons. It was more of a combination of Vietnam, WW2, and even Sci-Fi weaponry. Because we have so many weapons, I would try to summarize this as short as possible. Besides the typical M16 Assault Rifle, there is the Machine Pistol 40 (MP40) Submachine gun which was a standard-issue weapon of the Tan Elite Guard. If you have seen the Act I cut scene from Army Men II, towards the end, you will notice that the Tan Elite soldiers towards the left of Major Mylar are carrying such weapons. There are also some weapons that are capable of dismembering some of your enemies, such as the MG42 Heavy Machine Gun (HMG), which is useful for slaughtering waves of enemies and the Shotgun, which can be devastating in close-quarters combat. We do have Sci-Fi based weaponry mainly for the purpose of the Machines of War. For example, the Laser Rifle - standard-issue weapon for the MoW commando units (plastic-metal alloyed action figures which resembles Cathode from UT3), and the Tesla Cannon which is rarely found in the game (more especially in Campaign mode).

**Small Dev Talk: How will the User-Mod content work? Will users be submitting their content to a source?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** User-Mod content would probably work similar to most mod-supported games using the Unreal Engine 3 (most noticeably Unreal Tournament 3). The same rules would apply for modding most of the Unreal series PC games (or in UE3’s case UT3) - making maps via UnrealEd, importing Scripts and Mutators, even going as far as totally changing the game (TC Mods). Only difference - we would have our special “Mod” folder designed for adding custom content to the game as well as upload the Editor version of Army Men III (knowing how restrictive UDK can be sometimes). That does not mean we will be directly copying the UDK Editor or requiring Mod devs to download, install, and use the UDK to make mods for our game. That won’t work very well since the version and data won’t match and would eventually case so many unwanted errors. What we plan to do is similar to how we cook and package our game, except this time, we would configure the build scripts only include the essentials needed to successfully activate the editor mode and release the Army Men III Mod Developer Kit (MDK) as a separate download.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose to make the multiplayer a standalone?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Considering how our Beta release is nearly 3GB (Uncooked dev files are over 16GB), we feared there would not be enough space to add the competitive multiplayer mode - more especially since it will include a LOT more competitive gameplay than the Army Men 3 campaign which is mostly cooperative.

Army Men Multiplayer as a standalone expansion release is the competitive multiplayer version. Aside from the typical Deathmatch, CTF, King of Hill, and other game types seen in the original Army Men tactical shooters (and unlike those games, this one is only a third-person shooter), we will also include objective based game types such as Conquest, Demolition, Escort, Infection, and even Survival mode.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Although I was first introduced to the series from Sarge’s Heroes 2, I became a die-hard fan of the series ever since I played the original games, starting with Army Men II. However after learning of The 3DO company’s bankruptcy in 2004 (was 9 years old), I was really devastated. On the following day, I picked up Freedom Force, which had a very interesting storyline (and a difficult campaign mode). Then 2 days later, I came across this website: [http://www.freedomfans.com/](http://www.freedomfans.com/)

This is what first introduced me to Mod development

Ever since, I have been working on custom skins, and missions. That was when I later realized that I could use this opportunity to make a game tributing to the Army Men series, and hence I created the “Army Men X” mod. This was the very first iteration of what is now known as Army Men III. The mod would supposedly provide 2-3 hours of gameplay and would take place during the events of Army Men II. A nameless green soldier and his squad are being sent on a covert operation to infiltrate a Tan outpost located in the house’s attic in the Real World, unfortunately their plane was attacked and crashed-landed in the sandbox consequently destroying a portal. The player wakes up, only to find that he is the sole survivor of the crash. With the only portal destroyed and Green Army radio support being completely cut-off, the player is forced to single-handedly fight his way through the house and destroy the Tan fortress.

Unfortunately a year later, my computer suffered a hard drive failure which cost me my entire data. I was yet again devastated to find my work down the drain, nearly lost all motivation. It was until I came across Halo Custom Edition that gave me new hope to work on the mod. However this time, the mod’s story and gameplay ideas were overhauled and renamed to Army Men Extended. Eventually, when I thought I would never come across another HD failure…

…It happened AGAIN! Goodbye Halo CE mod! I was just lucky not much work was lost (like the FF mod).

Towards my freshman high school year, I came across Half-Life 2 and the Source SDK.

Witness the numerous and successful mods for the game (unlike Halo CE), I figured this would have been the best option for me so I switched to that game instead: [http://www.moddb.com/mods/army-men-extended](https://www.moddb.com/mods/army-men-extended)

Sadly, I overestimated the engine quite a bit. While the art was seemingly the least of my struggles and worries, the C++ programming code was just next to impossible to work with.

Fortunately on November 2009, the Unreal Development Kit was released. The indie game developer kit really helped this game by a LONG shot. It allowed me to get a lot of content and features done easier and faster, something I probably could never achieve otherwise as a HL2 or Halo CE Mod. Sure it had its cons, more especially for commercial products. But considering the fact that this is a free indie game, they were seemingly outweighed.

Sadly, I came across some team-related and demotivational struggles (was new to team management at the time) that nearly cost the project to be ceased indefinitely (lack of motivation and hope). Luckily, an independent game reviewer and storywriter Deckard Klein arrived at the last possible moment to save the project from what would seem to have been an inevitable doom. He introduced an effect story plot and concept that would in the long run prove to become very effective. He helped me realize the missing gap that had yet to be fixed in the original series - a DIRECT sequel to the original Army Men II game (No, Toys in Space does NOT count).

Finally, the team renamed the title to Army Men III with the new story plot that would take place directly where the last game left off. However, the new change ultimately cost me most of my team - inactive members, story-related conflicts, project-saboteurs and manipulators, ultimately forcing me to single-handedly complete the rest of the game.

On the bright side, the solo-developer work is really paying off.

**Small Dev Talk: What is personally your favourite part of Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** Well, as of what we have so far, my favorite part of Army Men III would be the Skirmish Mode and NPCs.

However in regards to what the game will have overall, that would be Online Cooperative Multiplayer.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Army Men III?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** The move to the Unreal Development Kit.

More of members started leaving the team due to their complaints of the Unreal Engine (more especially the level designers with their horrible experience with Unreal Tournament 3’s Editor) and the irrational fears of the controls and flexibility ending up like UT3’s. For some odd reason (at least as far as I know), many people did not like working with UDK or even UE3 at the time of its release. Not to mention, I started having a LOT of inactive developers later after.

Eventually when Deckard joined the team, everything seemed to have calmed down (even after the Army Men III title change), until the revised story plot was completed and introduced to the rest of the team (and partially until our previous PR manager joined the team). That was when the members started having conflicts and grudges. Then there were developers that tried to sabotage our progress either by working at 80% progress and suddenly leaving the team without notice suddenly requiring us to pay them, or sometimes they try the manipulation tricks and threats of suing us or slandering our game (More of the reason why our team now has an NDA). This is what many teams struggle with. It is very troublesome and frankly it’s intolerable.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Army Men III and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** The first Army Men III Beta release is April 30th 2013 - The 15th Anniversary of Army Men. The game will be completely Free-To-Play (No commercial cash shop will be necessary either).

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Franklin Iheanacho:** if you are a fan of the Army Men series (or at least Army Men II), Old school shooters like Unreal Gold, cooperative gameplay, or are looking for a fun F2P shooter with the similar Micro-Volts/Toy Story vibe with a combination of intense action gameplay, this is the game for you. However, strategy fans may cry foul.

Be sure to check out our website or more updates.

If you are experienced with the UDK and are willing to lend us a helping hand, you can contact us via our website.

Also, be sure to sign up on the community forums and join any of our social networks. It really helps us a LOT as this game still lacks the publicity and support it needs and deserves.

The larger the community and fan base as well the more skilled developers we have on the team, the sooner, faster, and better the outcome of the game.
