Fashion is always changing and coming up with new innovative methods to express meaning in a sense of clothing of accessories. A unique way to look at how this is done is by looking at D’clic. A new industrial urban accessories designed by Martial Yapo. You can find more on his [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1695278181/dclic-industrial-urban-accessories) or on his [website](http://www.dclicbyyapo.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is D’clic?**

**D’clic:** The signature D’Clic belt buckle was conceived by designer Martial Yapo on my frequent travels as a pro athlete.

The classic airplane belt buckle’s primary function is for security, but I saw a unique, raw and edgy material that could birth a new lineup of urban industrial fashion accessories. I immediately went about making my own, receiving constant praise whenever it was worn. This design really clicked, and I set to work on building the belt as a product and a brand.

**Small Dev Talk: The D’clic looks sort of like a seat belt, does the work the same as a seat belt will you just snap it in to each other?**

**D’clic:** Yes it is a seat belt buckle, so it has the same mechanism but a different function

**Small Dev Talk: The D’clic purse has a very unique design, why did you choose to design your purse like that?**

**D’clic:** I designed this purse because I wanted, first of all propose a product that is directly addressed to women but also to make a particularity and a difference with what we can find on boutique… creating reaction and surprise is the key of my creative system, you love or you don’t you still fascinating by the design of this purse.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed on your D’clic bag, there is a roll area at the top of the bag, is that for purely cosmetic purposes or can your bag actually be expanded and store more things in it?**

**D’clic:** For both actually, as the purse…I want make the difference by the material i used, even if everybody knows leather. You don’t find that much leather backpack out there, unless you hit the big brand. And the great thing of this back pack is that you can shape it differently and give him a different aspect by the way you closing it.

It can be roll or fold or leave with the extension up.

**Small Dev Talk: Also, what material is your D’clic bag and purse made out of?**

**D’clic:** Leather, cow hide and pig skin

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create D’clic?**

**D’clic:** Me and a group of friend were wearing the actual buckle from the airplane, this is when I was in college 10 years ago but I was always looking for some different color but of course I never could because those weren’t made for an aesthetic aspect facing the compliments, and my own demand I decided to create my own.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the designing of D’clic?**

**D’clic:** I will say dealing with manufacture.

**Small Dev Talk: How did you, Martial Yapo, the designer and creator of D’clic, get started in fashion?**

**D’clic:** By creating D'clic I’m a former architect. Always been into fashion for myself, and I guess natural flow of life drag to my everyday interest but to tell you the true I don’t consider myself as a fashion designer, for the simple reason as:

A : I don’t have a knowledge of a fashion designer

B : I don’t work the same way and I have a lot of respect for what they do

I truly conceptualize my product as an architect who love fashion…I will say I’m a creator
