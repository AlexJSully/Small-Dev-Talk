A few days ago I got the chance to talk with the developer Julian W. from Hivemind Tech on their upcoming horror game, Shadowlurker. Based off the meme, Shadowlurker, it brings a new meaning the aspect of horror games with new and innovative gameplay. To check out their official website, it can be found here at [http://www.crydev.net/project_db.php?action=project_profile&team_id=5289&project_id=5122](http://www.crydev.net/project_db.php?action=project_profile&team_id=5289&project_id=5122)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Shadowlurker?**

**Julian W.:** As the unity3D popular micro-game Slender was based off “Slenderman”, I decided that maybe it wasn’t up to speed with graphics, horror themes and character. Shadowlurker, or Uninvited House-guest, is let’s say, Slenderman’s successor. There was a spike in Shaowlurker memes back a year or two but while Slenderman only wraps you in his tentacle appendages, Shadowlurker plays mind-games before making you meet your demise. So he’s this ghostly figure that is always referred to as ‘That bump in the night’ or 'that beast under your bed’.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there a story and if so, what is it about?**

**Julian W.:** Currently I am working on a multiplayer debut, mainly to get community interest and support, but also to set the scene as to what panic the local villagers went through the night the Shadowlurker came to town. I have a small storyboard mapped out for the “Story Mode” which shall come out after “Multiplayer Mode” - which follows up on the town a week later after they went silent. Let’s say that the Shadowlurkers’ existence is a very sad and mournful one at that.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the main character like in Shadowlurker?**

**Julian W.:** In multiplayer, it’s the villagers vs Shaowlurker(s) (multiple as it will be based off team deathmatch, but in game-play you can push others to the ground to bait and get away, team up or hide on your own) - as for the follow-up Story mode, let’s say that sometimes people get suspicious when a village goes silent.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will the player get to meet in your game?**

**Julian W.:** Humans and Showlurkers. Yeah, imaginative, I know.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the Shadowlurker?**

**Julian W.:** The Shadowlurker is your nightmares, your fears, and your fate.

**Small Dev Talk: How close will this Shadowlurker resemble or relate to the meme, Shadowlurker?**

**Julian W.:** I don’t have much to go off as it’s all primarily sketches online, but I will be making it detailed, wrinkled and complete with Tessellation (DirectX 11)

**Small Dev Talk: Will this game always be taken place during the night?**

**Julian W.:** I’m hoping to release winter-time (northern hemisphere) which might be released around Christmas or New Year. That will take place during the day. I chose nighttime for the 3 main hits, though, as that’s always the creepiest times of days (And as they say, the fear is not the dark itself, it’s of what’s in it!)

**Small Dev Talk: How is the survival mode going to work in this game?**

**Julian W.:** “Three, Two, One, RUN!” - Basically, a small digital timer appears on-screen and when you finally get caught, you take a screencap and show your friends. Simple.

**Small Dev Talk: What unique features does your game have?**

**Julian W.:** If crap-your-pants-material counts, it would be that. Also, there will be no guns, no cheats, no health-packs. Just you, a torch, your legs and your fears. As for the Shadowlurkers themselves, an ungodly amount of terror.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Julian W.:** That would have to be the atmosphere and the immense attention to detail I’ve used.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on and does this game require high specs to play?**

**Julian W.:** Shadowlurker runs on any modern-ish hardware. I can confirm that it runs on Intel HD3000 Architecture, happily on Intel HD4000 Architecture, and on any decent dedicated or mobile graphics processor. I strongly advise you optimise your graphics and performance in-game before you properly play a game, the last thing you want is lag while running. It looks absolutely stunning in fullscreen maxed-out, and at the same time on the lowest settings and windowed, it still looks quite amazing. Shadowlurker utilizes the amazing CryEngine 3 - beautiful on high-end machines, responsive on low-end.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Shadowlurker and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Julian W.:** I’m going for the 'when it’s done’ system here, but I’d say it is about 72% complete, so maybe July or August. Watch its CryDev page for news etc. It will be completely free-to-play

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the reader?**

**Julian W.:** “Run, and don’t look back, whatever you do.”
