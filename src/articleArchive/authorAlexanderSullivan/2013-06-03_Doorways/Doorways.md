Open the door to a new exciting first person survival horror game, Doorways. Recently I got the chance to talk with Tobías Rusjan from Saibot Studios on their new game Doorways, a survival horror puzzle adventure game which you can find at [http://doorwaygame.com/](http://doorwaygame.com/) or support on their green light at [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109177197](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109177197).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** Doorways is a survival horror adventure.

It has a complex story, puzzles, creatures and other elements that fit the genre.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** You are Thomas Foster, a detective who works for a special organization that looks for criminals.

The agents have special abilities to find the criminals. They can look throw their eyes by touching the elements in the crime scene.

There’re some psychopaths that couldn’t be catch by the other agents. So Thomas is on the mission to find them.

You travel across strange and horrifying sceneries. What are exactly those places and what is exactly happening there will be your missions.

**Small Dev Talk: How is Doorway a puzzle-ridden adventure? What puzzles will be included in Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** There’re mind puzzles as well as timed and agility challenges.

This could be in relation with the scenery but also against creatures.

**Small Dev Talk: What elements in Doorway make it a horror game?**

**Saibot Studios:** As you can see in the screenshots, we like it dark. We also dedicated lot of effort to the sounds in the game. Both combined make a special atmosphere of horror.

It also has jump scares, but not in a cheap way. There are flashbacks with distorted images of tortures and executions.

The creatures will scare you in every situation. You need to avoid most of them because you’re defenceless.

**Small Dev Talk: What types of creatures/enemies will you encounter in Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** They vary depending upon each map. You can find lost souls of tortured victims, living statues, dead moving corpses and other.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** We play a lot of horror games and also watched a lot of horror movies from different times.

The main inspiration about game-play and atmosphere was the fantastic work of Frictional Games, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This guys really know how to create an unique and intense atmosphere of horror, working with the lights, the music and sounds, the confrontation with strange creatures, and more.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Doorway?**

**Saibot Studios:** Our favorite aspect of Doorways is the atmosphere. We try to make the player be immersive in the scene so he can fill the true fear.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Doorway and how did you overcome them?**

**Saibot Studios:** Here in Argentina the situation is a little complex in terms of money. Me (Tobías Rusjan) and my uncle and best friend: Iván Rusjan decided to start the project in a familiar way. Iván is the investor and I’m the director of the project.

But we don’t have too much money to pay too many salaries for a big team so every person in the project do more than just one roll in the development. For example I (besides directing the project) do programming, design, sound effects composition, marketing.

So these things take a lot of work, time and dedication. We love it, but those are true challenges.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Saibot Studios:** We are using Unity 4 Pro. I think this was a good decision, we don’t have to care about the engine, we make the game. Also, this engine is very flexible to port the game to multiple platforms.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for players on your upcoming game, Doorways?**

**Saibot Studios:** Just get some immerse headphones and prepare to play Doorways at night and in the darkness.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Doorways and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Saibot Studios:** We depend on the [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109177197) system. If we don’t get approved in the upcoming months, we probably launch the game in other sites.

The game will have a cost but we didn’t define it yet. There’s also a possibility of launching a demo, but it depends in how things go.

**Small Dev Talk: Your game is currently on Steam Greenlight which means you are trying to bring it onto Steam. If your game becomes Greenlit, will take advantage of Steam’s great features such as Workshop for any user create content or Big TV for controller support?**

**Saibot Studios:** Yes, we are currently competing in [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109177197). It’s very hard to become [Greenlit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109177197).

If we get into Steam, we probably use the Workshop for the achievement system.

And we’ll see about the Big TV for controller support. It could be a possibility.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Saibot Studios:** Yes. We want to thank you all the people that have been helping in the development of Doorways: the family, the colleagues and the friends who support us. We could never get so far without them. Thank you!
