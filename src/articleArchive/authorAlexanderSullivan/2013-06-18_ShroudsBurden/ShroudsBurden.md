**Small Dev Talk: Is there a story and if so, what is it about?**

**C. Scott:** Yes there is a story. The game takes place in 14th Century England. The player takes the role of William Shroud, a widowed father, with a son named David. David becomes deathly ill. William, a poor farmer, has no money to pay for David’s medicine. Pushed to his limits, William is forced to steal in order to acquire the means to save his son. The story highlights William’s struggle to do what is right, but at the same time do what is necessary to save his son. “What would you do for the ones you love?”

**Small Dev Talk: What is the main character, William, like?**

**C. Scott:** William is a middle-aged man in his 30’s, face worn from years of toil in the fields. He normally is quiet and reserved, but most of all is an honest man.

**Small Dev Talk: What unique features does your game have?**

**C. Scott:** The main features of this game are: Dynamic Light Detection - Real-time shadow detection adds to the realism of the game. A stray shadow can mean the difference between being caught and escaping. Dynamic Sound System - Making sure to keep your steps quiet in case of detection. Advanced Guard AI - Searching for you, believable movements and behaviours. The three main factors we’re embodying through this game are: Emotion, Immersion, and Fun. Emotionally, we want to point out the inner struggle William is going through by monologue or cut scenes. Where as many of today’s video games, the character is a silent figure with choosable dialogue options. This game is more of a journey. Immersion, believable artificial intelligence, detailed settings, and solid sound design. Lastly, fun. The player needs to have fun, we have several systems implemented in order to ensure freshness and variety to levels.

**Small Dev Talk: Is or will there be any multiplayer?**

**C. Scott:** No, the game is Single-Player only

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**C. Scott:** I’d say that my favorite aspect of the game is the tension the player feels when he slips by a guard undetected. That’s the magic of stealth games.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on and does this game need high specs to play?**

**C. Scott:** The engine being used is Unity 3d. The spec requirements will not be high to play.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Shroud’s Burden and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**C. Scott:** The expected launch date is still to be decided. The game will be sold as a regular commercial product

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**C. Scott:** The only thing I have to say is, get excited, there are passionate gamers, just like you, working on Shroud’s Burden!
