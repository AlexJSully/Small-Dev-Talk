Son of Nor is a new exciting action adventure game where you, the player, can take control of the environment around you to fight off enemies and solve puzzles. Not long ago, I got the chance to talk with a developer from Stillalive Studios on their new game, Son of Nor, Julian Mautner. You can check out their game at [http://stillalive-studios.com/portfolio-item/son-of-nor/](https://stillalive-studios.com/portfolio-item/son-of-nor/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** Son of Nor is a third-person action adventure game for Windows, Mac and Linux that can be played in single and multiplayer co-operative mode. Its set in a dynamic fantasy desert world filled with intriguing and challenging creatures and puzzles, where the environment can be shaped by the player’s magic.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** ‘The Edge’, the last refuge of the human race; located in the northern mountains of the desert world, Noshrac and home to mankind after their defeat in ‘The Great War’ against the reptilian Sarahul Empire.

With the intention of exterminating the human race, the refuge is soon discovered by the Sarahul Empire whose armies are being readied for the attack.

As a Son of Nor, a human blessed by the moon goddess with the power of telekinesis and the ability to terraform, your purpose is to protect what’s left of your race and to save it from almost certain extinction.

Unfortunately, there is more than one power working against you in Son of Nor. You will uncover a traitor from within your own ranks is secretly plotting with a mysterious entity. As you follow them into the depths of the earth you discover unimaginable powers, protected by temples of an ancient race that was wiped from the face of Noshrac millennia ago.

Exploring the temples and robbing the magic held within enables you to control the elements of ‘Fire’, ‘Wind’ and ‘Essence’. A very valuable gift in the wake of the impending attack of the Sarahul. But remember, magic always comes with a price…

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story behind Nor?**

**Julian:** Nor is the goddess of the Humans, she represents the night, the moon and the protective veil of darkness; Opposed to Lur, the god of the Sarahul people which represents the sun, the light and the strength it gives to them lizards.

Humans believe that Nor is the reason behind their magic, Telekinesis and Terraforming. She was first concepted or heard of by the humans when Simeon, the first magical human fled from the persecuting Sarahul into the Nanshiri desert. There while he was near death, she appeared before him leading him into an Oasis where he gained back his health. On his return to civilization, he established the Path of Nor as the human religion, became the first Son of Nor and built the first Radir (Nor’s Church) to revere Nor and school prodigies (Humans that discover their powers but still haven’t been trained and gained the titles of Son of Nor).

**Small Dev Talk: What is the main character like and what inspired you to create that character?**

**Julian:** There is no main playable character. We have created a variety of playable characters which differ in sex, looks, personality and backstory. But they all share three common things: They live in The Edge, they are Sons of Nor and they go through the journey that the main story presents.

We have decided to do this so the player can choose whatever looks and feels like them the most and of course to have some differentiation between each player when playing in 4 player co-op mode.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the dynamic sand manipulations system in Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** In the game you’ll be able to terraform, this is the term we use to move the sand. In basic words you can move the sand up to create dunes, or down to create holes, but there’s more than that to it. You can use terraforming to hide from enemies, to make biped enemies lose balance, to reach higher places, to reach lower places without dying when you drop, to dig and find secret hidden doors or treasures below the sand, to put pressure below stuff such as a brick wall and break it, stop quicksand for some given moment and of course whatever other outcome that these mechanics allow.

**Small Dev Talk: Son of Nor features a telekinesis ability where you can pick up objects and move/use them. Can you pick any object you see in the game and move/use them?**

**Julian:** The premise of our game is that the environment is your weapon, so every little thing that we put into a map we try to make it interactive. You can pick up carrots from a farm, rocks from the desert, baskets from the market, bones from a graveyard, you can even tear out rocks from a canyon wall! But as in any other game there are some limitations that have more to do with the quantity of processes that a computer can make, so not absolutely everything is pickable.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you describe to use what the spell fusion feature of Son of Nor is and what the player can do with it?**

**Julian:** At some point in the game you obtain elemental powers: Wind, Fire and Essence. These elements when casted leave a magic ridden area that stays active for a while. If another player gets to cast another elemental spell on this “active magic area” then a combination of spells will happen.

For example: Player 1 casts windpush on a sarahul warrior group which will push them back. As they run in again to attack player 1, player 2 casts a fireburst on them that will burn them. Since fireburst was casted on the windpush “active magic area” a fire tornado will commence making the enemies swirl around helplessly while being burned at the same time.

**Small Dev Talk: How is the multiplayer going to work in Son of Nor? Will there be a verses or PvP mode?**

**Julian:** Currently the game is planned to be co-op multiplayer, it can either be played single player or with up to 4 players. In multiplayer you can combine elements faster, discover hidden places that are only possible to reach in this mode and of course have fun with friends. PvP is a mode that has been thought of and we’ll see if we add it in the future.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the environment like in Son of Nor and what people and enemies will you come across in the game?**

**Julian:** Noshrac is the mapped and known land of present day world in Son of Nor

Noshrac is a peninsula that can be separated in three sections vertically. The south section is the Richlands where the Sarahul Empires resides, while the other two sections are desert.

At the north frontier there’s a mountain chain, where The Edge is located, and beyond lies the Wanton Desert, while at the south, east and west frontiers borders the Oraah Ocean.

During the game you will explore mostly the desert parts of Noshrac and you will come across fearsome wild creatures and different enemy ranks from the Sarahul Empire.

**Small Dev Talk: Is Son of Nor a linear game or Open World?**

**Julian:** You visit different places in Noshrac in an order that makes sense with the story, although we have made these places big and full of secrets to encourage exploration.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** The main vision for the game was born in a dream at night. Then it grew and I thought a lot about it, until it finally was matured enough to become a game-play-vision.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** My favorite aspect of Son of Nor is that almost everything you think would be cool to do is actually possible! These mechanics really let the player be inventive and creative.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Son of Nor and how did you overcome them?**

**Julian:** As a distributed team the biggest challenge is dealing with language barriers, cultural differences and of course time-zones. But with time and practice we found solutions to all of these problems and now our rhythm in development has reached a pace where we are really happy with everything.

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like being the Lead Developer on Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** I very much like it, having all these creative people around me and working with it. On the other hand it is also very much work. You are busy all the time as Lead Developer. Best case: you should be available 24/7. But I never regret my decision of pulling this off!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Julian:** Start in the “hobby-scene”! Pull of several small projects on your own, without wanting them to be commercial. And make sure to start at the basics. Do not use a finished Engine like Unity/Unreal/… to make your first games, but start from scratch. Only this way you really understand it, and only this way you can become a really good game-developer.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine are you using for Son of Nor?**

**Julian:** For Son of Nor we use Unity3D

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Son of Nor and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Julian:** We expect to launch this game in Q2 of 2014 and the price tag will probably be around $20. The game is not planned to be Free-To-Play.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Julian:** Thanks to everyone for your support, your attention and your time. We are really excited about this game and we hope you are too! Please support us in our Kickstarter campaign that is launching around the 24th of April and please spread the word about it on your social networks. Thank you!
