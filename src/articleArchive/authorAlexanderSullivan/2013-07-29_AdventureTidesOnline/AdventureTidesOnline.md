This is the era of adventure. Whether you choose to be a headhunter, marksmen, monk or knight; this if your opportunity to fight and change the tides of this war in Adventure Tides Online. Recently I got the chance to talk with the developers from Saker Games on their new Free-To-Play MMO, Adventure Tides Online. You can find more about their game on their [website](http://www.adventurertides.com/) or on their [IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/games/adventurer-tides-online) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SakerGames).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** ATO is our first public game, it’s an action RPG in which players will play online together. It’s more like an MMO, but also features adventure, strategic and sandbox elements. The game will also focus on the Player vs. Player part involving war between clans for territory, resources and glory.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** At the dawn of the third era, 130 years after the 1st Domination War a new world order began to emerge. Fallen empires are trying to recover, new ones are rising. This is the era of adventurers. There are unconquered territories to be conquered. A gold rush began and you are one of the treasure hunters that travel to the far lands to find gold and long forgotten treasures. As a player you will help your clan to take control over the lands that are rich in gold and treasures. Besides this the players will take part in expeditions to the Thirroar Highlands and aid in the founding of the Covenant of the Seven Kings.

**Small Dev Talk: Will Adventure Tides Online be a classed based game? If so, what classes will the player be able to play as in Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** Yes, there will be several basic classes at the beginning, but we’ll extend the list in future updates. The planned list is: Headhunter (Assassin), Champion, Marksman, Bard, Blade, Monk, Knight, Paladin, Cleric, Warlock/Witch, Battle mage, Magus/Wizzard. Here I should note that the class will be a guide only for the player. It will suggest how to advance, what to learn, since it will determine the maximum level of certain skills and will give some special traits. You may end up as an assassin archer mage if you want, but obviously some of your specialties won’t be as advanced as if you would learn in a single class way.

**Small Dev Talk: What makes Adventure Tides Online an action based game? Will that mean it will be an aim and shoot style combat?**

**Saker Games:** Yes, the combat style is more like in Skyrim or Assassin’s Creed. We found the classical MMO-RPG style combat a little bit boring. So we want to implement a more challenging combat system with combos and different fighting styles, like martial arts, ranged combat, sword fight and magic. The way you fight is up to you.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of enemies will the player come across in Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** Usually players will have to fight against animals, humanoids, bandits, goblins and orcs in the mountains, and of course other players. But when night falls you might encounter demons, monsters and ancient undead, creatures like the Vureem.

**Small Dev Talk: What will the player see environmentally in the continent of Yarien?**

**Saker Games:** The continent of Yarien is really varied, there are rocky mountains, highlands, steppes, deserts, rainforests and so on. In the first release we plan to have the game to take place near the Little Uthar Mountains that are high and craggy. The place is rich in gold and other resources, and takes to the inland sea of Eárimdor. On this steep land players can admire pine, oak forests, creeks, watelfalls, old ruins and some recently built cities.

**Small Dev Talk: How will Adventure Tides Online be different and unique compared to the current games on the MMO market?**

**Saker Games:** As we said we want an action based combat system, but besides this we want to give the players some really interesting features like building their own houses, farms, crafting and cooking, selling goods at the town markets, building castles for their clans and defending them from other clans. We will also build a little bit different reputation system that will define the personality of the character too. You can be a hero or a public enemy, member of evil or of honored clans. You might keep good relation with the city council, to get some protection, you can even hire NPC soldiers to defend your clan castle.

One other thing to mention is the absence of the classic leveling system. You don’t need to collect experience points to level up, instead all your deeds will increase a certain skill. How much you can increase a skill will be defined by your characters class.

These are big plans, we know. But we hope all planned features will be released in future updates.

**Small Dev Talk: Will Adventure Tides Online include a micro-transaction shop? If so, what will the player find in the micro-transaction shop?**

**Saker Games:** Basically the game will be free to play, but with some minor limitations. There will be a lifetime membership fee that players might pay once and then they unlock all the features. Besides this, sometime in the future, we plan to introduce a micro payment system to allow players to buy extra stuff for their characters, and account-wide customization options, power-ups, crafting recipes, resources, faster mounts, etc.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** As I had been playing table-top RPGs for a long time, I wanted to create my own world. These games usually have a really huge universe that captivates the imagination. Then I started to sketch out Yarien and its history. In the meantime I found some fun sandbox type games like Minecraft. I thought mixing up a lot of features of RPG, action, adventure, sandbox and strategic games would result in a great, lifelike game. So now, we are trying to make all of this a reality.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** Imagine that your clan lays siege on an enemy castle. There’s smoke and blood all over the battlefield. Cannon balls are hitting the ground right next to you. Then your soldier fires back, the stone walls fall apart then finally you start running to get into the castle and start fighting against other players. Using your skills you may become the hero of the day, while your team gives you a split of the loot.

Or imagine that you’ve travelled quite a lot with your character, helped a lot of people during quest, fought many monsters, and collected a lot of treasure. What can you do? Rest a little bit. Buy a piece of land in a village or next to a city, build your own house or even a farm.

I think these are the aspects I would like in a game like ATO.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Adventure Tides Online?**

**Saker Games:** The combat and action system is the most challenging part right now. We need to melt a lot of animations together to make character motions look good. This requires a lot of work, but without it, the combat system would look like very dull.

Another tough thing is the game server, network communication and synchronization. We need to optimize it day and night, because speed is a key thing in multiplayer games.

I think we share a common problem with other indie developers. At the moment we work in part time as game developers. Hopefully this will change in the future, but until then we need to find the way between our job and personal problems to achieve what we call ATO.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming developers?**

**Saker Games:** Never give up! Even if you are the last man standing. Not all of us are the next heroes of the game industry, but you could never know how your life might change if you are dedicated to dream, learn and create.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Adventure Tides Online and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Saker Games:** We would like to release an alpha version ASAP, in Q1 of 2014. For that we need a successful Indiegogo campaign I think. This autumn we will start it if everything goes well. Then periodically we will release updates with new features and content for free.

As I mentioned before the game will be Free-To-Play, but with limitations. There will be a one-time fee for lifetime VIP membership. Which basically means that you buy the full game for around 20 US dollars. We hope we’ll be able to maintain at least one game server by ourselves even if no one buys the game.
