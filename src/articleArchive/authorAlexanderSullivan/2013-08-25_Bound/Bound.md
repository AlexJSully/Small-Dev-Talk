Have you ever wanted to watch an entire movie made from Lego bricks? Check out Bound, a new dramactic adventure made entirely from Lego bricks! I recently got the chance to talk with Greg Tull from Monitogo Studios on their recently successful Kickstarter film, Bound. You can find more on their [website](http://www.monitogostudios.com/bound/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** Bound is a 45 - 60 min. dramatic adventure brickfilm. It’s shot in 1080p on extensive sets and involves hundreds of characters!

The first promo was cool. I mean, it had awesome effects, great lighting/composition, and was super professional. But there was a big problem. We didn’t tell you our story. So here you go, a little look into - us.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** Darkness threatens a happy medieval world when the rogue knight Guaramoth begins to raise an army. Zathen, a great warrior of the king, vows to kill the rogue and gain vengeance for the murder of his father. When things quickly go awry and Zathen is made a prisoner of Guaramoth in his imposing fortress, it falls upon his half siblings and their elderly guardian to come to his rescue. Nathan and Abigail, led by Micah, embark on a perilous quest to bring back their lost brother and friend. Though they look on the bright side and trust in their Lord, danger lurks at every turn. Their courage and dedication to their quest will be firmly tested…

**Small Dev Talk: What is Nathan and Abigail like and what is their story?**

**Greg Tull:** Nathan is 16, mostly courageous, loves adventure, and is not unwilling to take on challenges - though he doesn’t always think things through. Abigail is 12, homely, likes a quiet life, but is faithful and becomes quite a hardy little gal by the end of the story. They’re the orphaned siblings of a hunter and a modest women who were lost in a dreadful accident when they were young. Now their older half-brother Zathen and an elderly guardian named Micah look out for them.

**Small Dev Talk: What genre can Bound be classified as?**

**Greg Tull:** Medieval action/adventure drama

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like making a lego based movie? How are you filming it?**

**Greg Tull:** Tough and easy at the same time. We have infinite control over our characters, lighting, locations, weather. At the same time, mistakes are brutal and everything in stop motion takes a VERY LONG TIME.

**Small Dev Talk: How long does it take to record a one minute scene using lego?**

**Greg Tull:** A week if all goes well. Sometimes longer…

**Small Dev Talk: How much did it cost to buy all the legos you used in Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** At this point we are around $6,500.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there a moral focus in Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** Absolutely. Family is worth saving, and sharing the Gospel is of utmost importance; it’s worth experiencing suffering and facing the toughest trials.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** God. Other brickfilms. And my brother was into film. Plus I just love film in general.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** Oooh! The big sets and the advanced animating techniques. I can cheat in a double answer, right?

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the filming of Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** Lack of funding, bad timeline estimation, just flat out how LONG animation takes to create, and space limitations. Welcome to indie film!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming film makers?**

**Greg Tull:** Study movies, practice a lot, and then come up with a great short story. Tell it to the world!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Bound?**

**Greg Tull:** April 2014. That’s if we get our funding; otherwise it may be a while.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Greg Tull:** If you love film, go find one to work on or support. At least just once. It’s awesome!
