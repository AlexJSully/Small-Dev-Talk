Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers is a new exciting comic by Griot Enterprises that mixes the genres of sci-fi and kung-fu into one amazing adventure. Not long ago, I got the chance to talk with the CEO of Griot Enterprises, Jiba Molei Anderson about their new comic, Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers which you can check out for yourself at: [http://griotenterprises.com/](https://www.griotenterprises.com/) or support it at [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outworld-return-of-the-master-teachers-round-two](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outworld-return-of-the-master-teachers-round-two?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sasdeep&utm_content=link&sscid=61k3_9r068#/) .

**Small Dev Talk: What is Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers is a property geared towards males aged 10 -35. In addition, females in the same age bracket may become a large part of our audience as well due to a strong, capable female cast in the series. Finally, we may find a large adult audience as well. Outworld is reminiscent of such properties as Star Wars, Dreadstar & Warp and kung-fu films such as Hero and The Five Deadly Venoms.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story of Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** The Diaspora System is under the iron grip of Oro, The Despot and his Beret Sheri armada led by his acolyte, The Paladin. The Diaspora, once a galaxy devoted to peace and diversity, has become the Utopia, a totalitarian society dedicated to expanding its territories through war, subjugation and destruction.

However, a rag tag band of rebels led by a disgraced Master will provide to the key to the Diaspora’s liberation and will ignite a revolution that will restore the glory of the Master Teachers and bring justice to a beleaguered solar system.

**Small Dev Talk: What genre can Outworld be classified as?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers is a science fiction, kung-fu epic spanning 3 generations.

**Small Dev Talk: Who are the Master Teachers and why have they been outlawed?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** The Amesha Spentas, or Master Teachers, are an order of warrior griots that ignited the first Revolution, which liberated the galaxy and prompted the creation of the Diaspora. That order was discredited and blamed for a series of terrorist attacks in the galaxy. Outlawed by Oro, they have hunted to the brink of extinction.

**Small Dev Talk: Where is Outworld taken place?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** In the galaxy once known as the Diaspora, which is currently divided into the Utopian Collective and the Outworld separated by an expanse of space known as the Ridge.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the characters like in Outworld and who were they inspired by?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** It’s a kung-fu movie, it’s a Sci-Fi flick. Outworld is grand science fantasy, which speaks to the diversity and disparity of what’s happening in our world today. The characters are larger than life, my heroes all have feet of clay and are doing what they do as a penance for their actions years past. My heroes carry a lot of regret, but are noble in their intent and accessible in their motivations.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to write this story of Outworld?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers is the first concept I created. I was 11 years old when Return of the Jedi was released. For some reason, Luke’s evolution to full Jedi Knight and the ultimate redemption of Anakin Skywalker, now known as Darth Vader, resonated and sparked something within my burgeoning imagination.

I envisioned alien races featuring a race of beings that evolved from cats (I was reading Jim Starlin’s Dreadstar also at the time). Imagine my horror when the next year, a certain animated cartoon called Thundercats hit the small screen… RANKIN BASS (shaking fist to the gods in defiant anger)!!!!!!!

A few years earlier, I had seen a science-fiction play inspired by Star Wars and Marvel comic books like Doctor Strange called Warp, produced by Lee Gotfried. Warp later became the flagship title for Chicago-based First Comics.

I’m a second-generation “Trekkie” and a big science fiction fan, but Warp grabbed a hold of me because the hero, Lord Cumulus, was played by an African-American. All of these elements went into the stew that would become Outworld.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you intended to bring a moral or meaning to the story of Outworld?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Outworld is a commentary on what happens after the Revolution, when the ideals and goals of a movement become co-opted and corrupted to further agendas counter to the philosophies the Revolution hoped to establish. It’s also about First World economic warfare against the lower classes.

**Small Dev Talk: During the development and creation of Outworld, what type of challenges did you face in the creation of Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** The biggest challenges in developing Outworld are exposure and time. As I handle all aspects of Griot Enterprises from creating the property to producing the book to marketing the product, you can imagine the amount of time it takes to work all of these aspects. Also, though we have digital access and social media to help facilitate getting the word out, you still have to take the time to get the word out… I wish I had more time, or could clone myself to handle every aspect of this business!

**Small Dev Talk: Being an indie developer of comics for a while with many great properties such as Dignity & Divinity and The Horsemen, do you have any recommendations for upcoming and rising artists?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Comics are a medium, a craft and a language with a set of standards that must be maintained. In order to create comics, you must understand the medium, develop your craft and understand its language. Comics are also a business. If you want to have a career in comics, then you must develop and maintain the business aspect of your chosen profession. It’s not easy and business ebbs and flows. But, if you have the passion and the drive, you can succeed in this business.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** Outworld grew up with me and has become the benchmark of my evolution as an artist and a human being.

Soon, you’ll see what an 11-year old’s imagination can create.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Outworld?**

**Jiba Molei Anderson:** May, 2013. The deadline for the campaign is April, 24 2013. Here is the link for the campaign:
