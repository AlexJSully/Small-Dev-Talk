Will you be an archer or a warrior as you tour the grand land of Gloria Victis, traveling on perilous adventures while slaying countless enemies? Not long ago I got the chance to talk with the developers from Black Eye Games on their new upcoming MMORPG, Gloria Victis. You can visit their official website at [http://gloriavictisgame.com/](https://www.gloriavictisgame.com/en)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Gloria Victis is a Realistic Free to Play Medieval MMORPG that has a non target-based combat system designed in the spirit of realism and passion. It is a game developer by gamers, with gamers and for gamers.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story and gameplay in Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**There will be storyline quests that allow the player to become accustomed to game lore but mainly non-linear quests and content that is dependent on the player’s moral choices, actions and reputations with NPCs, so in that sense the player writes his or her own story.

**Small Dev Talk: On your official website, you say that Gloria Victis has nations based off nations that actually existed in the medieval times. What nations are these and why did you choose them? How will nations affect the gameplay?**

**Black Eye Games:**Nations are drawn from Europe as well as the Near East, choosing a nation will impact how the character will look in customization, the player will be able to customize but their character will have specific racial features. Equipment will matter for factions as well as the factions have faction specific equipment which will have aesthetic differences as well as some performance variations for example the Northern Faction will host many fur-trimmed equipment.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of weapons and armour will we see available in Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Basically everything that existed during the Middle Ages will be in Gloria Victis, with combat styles and animations based on how they were used back in the ages, plate armour for instance would be good for blocking blows but the player will still take damage from heavy weapons due to the shockwaves rippling through the body. Every weapon will be researched and we hope to be as historically accurate as possible.

**Small Dev Talk: What can the character’s companions do in Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Pets in the game will be realistic too and serve more practical purposes, hawks for instance can help the player hunt in the sky, hounds will be able to hunt boars and chase deer and pigeons will be able to send messages.

**Small Dev Talk How is the class-less system supposed to work in Gloria Victis? What options or progress can the players make to create their unique characters?**

**Black Eye Games:**The player can build his character as he wishes in terms of development but there is only a certain amount a character can learn, how the player chooses if completely up to them. After all in real life there is only a certain amount of things one can learn.

**Small Dev Talk: A feature that I am really excited for in your game is the housing feature. Can you tell us more about the housing system you have in Gloria Victis? What can you put in or around the player’s home?**

**Black Eye Games:**We had hoped for non-instanced housing system but due to the engine we are building the game on it is impossible due to technical issues which means housing will have to be instanced. Players will be able to customize their house according to their tastes and have decorations such as trophies plants etcetera for example a blacksmith will be able to put a furnace in his house so each house will be unique.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the environment like in Gloria Victis and how big is the world in Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Environment will vary from place to place depending on geographical factors as well as seasons and weather. The open world environment will be massive and will encompass 16+ maps. As Gloria Victis is realistic there will be no teleportation travel so the beautiful varying landscape will form an integral part of travelling and therefore add to the immersion.

**Small Dev Talk: Being an MMO, will Gloria Victis have a micro-transaction or item shop? If so, what will we see in the micro-transaction or item shop?**

**Black Eye Games:**Gloria Victis will be free to play but will have an item shop, these items will strictly only be limited to cosmetic items and will not affect gameplay in anyway, items will be cosmetic items such as fancy medieval clothing and dresses for aesthetic purposes or special furniture for houses.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Games currently being released tend to be games with generic quests, recycled textures, pay to win Korean Grindfests. The lack of a quality game of play caused us to take matters into our own hands to create a high quality realistic game that will be breaking away from what we call the “Korean Paradigm” of sparkling equipment, high fantasy, weird bestiary and grind-based gameplay.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Gloria Victis?**

**Black Eye Games:**Personally my favourite aspect of Gloria Victis is the immersion, when the player steps into the game he would feel as if he himself is in that Medieval World as opposed to simply controlling a toon that is in that world. NPCs in Gloria Victis are not simply questing props but have their own personalities and attitudes and relations with the player, they are in fact part of the community. In fact we did a poll on our Facebook Page regarding this and around 60% voted for “Realistic Medieval World” as their favourite with 30% voting for “Sandbox Character Development”, the immersion is something I have not felt since nine years ago when I first stepped into the world of Runescape, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish them success on their Runescape 3 Launch.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Gloria Victis and how did you overcome them?**

**Black Eye Games:**Gloria Victis is a project that has been worked on for over one and a half years without funding or pay. As such the chief difficulties range from funds for buying software integral in creating the game, marketing, hosting and retainment costs. Luckily for us, the spirit in which we create the game in which is passion to create a game that truly belongs to players has drawn the attention of countless entities that offer their services and products for free or at a discounted cost, for example Unity Technologies who provide us with leases on their software. We also implement our own marketing strategies that differ from other MMORPGs due to monetary limitations and rely mainly on word of mouth as well as free media patronage.

**Small Dev Talk: It is hard to create and keep an MMO alive, especially an indie one. How do you plan on competing in MMO game market and keeping your players happy and entertained?**

**Black Eye Games:**Many game companies have folded due to placing fiscal goals before player satisfaction first, you can only screw your players a certain amount of times before they end up leaving. Gloria Victis is unique as we as developers are in fact gamers and we include gamers in the development process such as voting on how game mechanics should be and submitting concepts which we review and after due process we implement. As such, Gloria Victis will be really the only MMO that truly belongs to players.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Black Eye Games:**Unity Engine

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Black Eye Games:**Your fans and players are your most valuable resource and on the other hand, developers that listen are gamer’s most valued people. Treat your fans and players with respect and utilize this precious resource.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Gloria Victis and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Black Eye Games:**Gloria Victis will be free to play and definitely not pay to win. We are currently at Pre-Alpha stages of the project with the base game mechanics in place so the rest should not take as long.
