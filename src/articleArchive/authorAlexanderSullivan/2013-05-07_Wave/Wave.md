It’s time to wear the future! With the new Wave technology, you can wear a fashionable bracelet that syncs with your mobile device or event to flash to notifications or with the music at the club. Recently I got the chance to talk with a developer behind this amazing new technology of Wave and CEO of Cloudsona, Paul Fulton. You can check out Wave by Cloudsona at [http://wavewristband.com](https://wavewristband.com) or support it [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/667986286/wave-a-lighted-wristband-controlled-by-your-smartp?ref=category).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Wave?**

**Paul:** Wave is a fashionable silicone wristband that lights up with alerts and lets you create amazing light shows with other Wave wristbands.

The Wave wristband lets you see at a glance with a flashing color who is calling, texting, or messaging you when it’s too loud to hear your phone when it’s in your purse or pocket. You can assign colors and patterns to your closest friends and important contacts, or be notified when an event is set to start. And, notifications can easily be dismissed with a shake of your wrist or a push of a button. Initial notifications include: Calls, Messages, Tweets, Email, Timers, and Calendar alerts. Wave is available on [Wave kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/667986286/wave-a-lighted-wristband-controlled-by-your-smartp?ref=category).

**Small Dev Talk: How does Wave work?**

**Paul:** Wave connects wirelessly to your iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth. Setting up Wave is as easy as pairing the Wave wristband to your phone. Our mobile app allows you to set up Wave to glow in different colors and patterns when certain people call or message. You can turn off the alert with a shake of your wrist or the push of a button.

**Small Dev Talk: Which mobile OS will Wave work for? iOS? Android? Windows Mobile? And/or Blackberry?**

**Paul:** Wave works with iPhone 4S and 5 running iOS 6 and up and with Android devices running OS2.3 and up. We have Windows on the roadmap.

**Small Dev Talk: How does the Wave mobile app sync with notifications? Will it work with all notifications on mobile device or specific ones?**

**Paul:** We pull notifications off the operating system and certain apps as well as our cloud service. Of course not all notifications are available to us, but the vast majorities are.

**Small Dev Talk: What sizes will Wave come in or will it be adjustable?**

**Paul:** Wave uses hypoallergenic silicone rubber and is available in three sizes: Small - 6in/15cm, Medium - 7in/18cm, and Large - 7.75in/20cm

**Small Dev Talk: Can a user of Wave personalize their Wave wristband?**

**Paul:** Wave is customizable. Of course the band can be any color when it lights up, but Wave also can have personalized faceplates. Wave ships with several faceplates to choose from in different colors and patterns to match user’s style and taste. We also have a brushed aluminum faceplate available. In addition, we provide a downloadable template so users can make their own faceplate graphics on standard photo paper. They can be creative or show their passion to a cause.

**Small Dev Talk: What features will we see in this new personal Wave wristband that was not available to the DJ/Entertainment version?**

**Paul:** Of course, the personal version was made to work outside concert and sporting venues, so the personal Wave is all about the user. Providing alerts is the most valuable feature of the personal Wave, while we retain the group lighting features of our commercial version.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the planned battery life of Wave? Does it have the potential for an individual wear it all day and charge it a night when sleeping?**

**Paul:** Because we use the lower power Bluetooth 4.0, Wave’s rechargeable Li-Ion battery has enough power for a week of alerts or a night or two of music lighting.

**Small Dev Talk: What developer potential is there available for Wave? How can developers use Wave for their video games?**

**Paul:** The potential for developers with Wave is virtually unlimited. Since we have an open SDK, accelerometers, lights, hyper-location data, and easy access to our cloud services, developers can use Wave as a remote control or alert device for almost any mobile app or Internet event. We have developers lined up to make video game controllers, automatic location check-ins, child finders, weather alerts for sailors, dating apps, health apps, athlete apps, and much more.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Wave?**

**Paul:** Over the last year, we provided lighted wireless wristbands to fans at concerts and clubs in Hollywood and Las Vegas. The audience became an active part of the show as the wristbands lit up together in sync when the performer controlled the wristband lighting to the music with our iPad app. The crowd loved the experience. After the shows, many fans asked us if they could get the DJ’s iPad app on their smartphone. We listened and designed a personal version of the wristband using Kickstarter to fund the production.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Wave?**

**Paul:** There are so many. I would have to say the fact that this is the most affordable wearable device open to developers on the planet. There is so much Wave can do and we are excited to see how useful they are going to be for everyone.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Wave and how did you overcome them?**

**Paul:** There were many. The band was tricky. We had to design a band that was fashionable, light transmitting, and manufacturable. Our design went through a lot of testing and we have patents pending on its design. Getting the radios to work well while minimizing the antenna and interference was interesting. The whole concept was groundbreaking so we have many features and techniques patent pending.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Paul:** Open your mind. There’s a lot you can do with Wave. Think of Wave as an extension to your app that can allow your users to be expressive with light. Wave also works well as a remote control when using a phone directly is too cumbersome or illegal in the case of driving.

**Small Dev Talk: When is the expected release date for Wave and how much will it cost?**

**Paul:** Our commercial version of Wave is in production now and available to artists, venues and brands. Our personal version will be available directly from us and select retailers in September.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Paul:** Wearable devices are coming. Wave is a great way to start your personal journey in wearable tech since Wave is similar to an awareness band that many people already wear, but is so much more. Please check out our Wave kickstarter campaign to pre-order one and join the revolution!
