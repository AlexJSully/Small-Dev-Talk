I recently got the chance to talk with the developers of the upcoming social game for the iOS, Andriod and Facebook: Prisonhood. A truly unique game where the player will experience playing a prisoner and face the challenges of the prison life. You can check the game out here at: [http://www.feihuinteractive.com/games/prisonhood.html](http://www.feihuinteractive.com/games/prisonhood.html) or support them on their indiegogo at [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prisonhood-the-game](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prisonhood-the-game?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sasdeep&utm_content=link&sscid=61k3_9wnkh#/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Prisonhood?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** It is an original story based, cross-platform game developed by Fei Hu Interactive for iOS, Android, and Facebook

**Small Dev Talk: Is there a story and if so, what is it about?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** Yes, starting out, you’re a bad guy! You’re guilty! And now you’re locked-up! Worse, you’re a rookie among the prison rank-and-file – easy prey for any prison veteran. But, as a long time thug, you understand the rules of the game and what you need to do to ensure your survival. Play by the warden’s rules while establishing your reputation and base of absolute power. There is also a deep back story unfolding which you can sample from the first 2 editions of our free comic book that are available now

**Small Dev Talk: What unique features does your game have?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** Besides the very unique prison setting, we have a complex game that combines traditional social task based gameplay, RPG elements, mini-games (that also are tasks), 2 social games, and cool features like bribing guards, and our gang management system.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there or will there be any multiplayer?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** We utilize asynchronous play in our game. We feature social PvP gameplay with our 2 social games, Dog Pound, and The Ring. The Ring is an asynchronous ‘arm wrestle’ where you bet against friends to see if you can out-wrestle them. Dog Pound is a cool PvP asynchronous ‘battle’ where you put your gang against another player’s gang and go head-to head. You need to build a solid gang for this, and can utilize some great special powers to help you win.

**Small Dev Talk: The game feature in-game task, what type of in-game tasks will there be?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** We have a number of different task classes including: Routine Tasks (simple daily tasks you would experience in prison), Business Tasks (where you trade items), Power Tasks (where you establish credibility by fighting other inmates), and Social Tasks (involving gifting and stealing from friends). All tasks can be accessed from your ‘Black Book’

**Small Dev Talk: How does the reputation system work in this game?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** Reputation is effectively your ‘score’ and is earned by completing tasks and activities in the game. You will also progress through a number of ‘Ranks’ including – Rookie, Sophmore, Junior, Veteran, and Lifer

**Small Dev Talk: In the trailer for the game, it says “recruit”, does this mean the player can create their own gang? And if so, what can you do with that gang?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** Yes, definitely. You need to recruit inmates to form a strong gang that you can use to fight in the Dog Pound. Gang members will have different combinations of attributes such as HP, Attack, Defense, Intelligence, and they may also harvest you some cool weapons or armor. They don’t stay in your gang forever, so you have to make the most of them while you have them!

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** The depth and originality of the prison universe that provides a platform to create cool characters, interesting storylines, and some great gameplay mechanics.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Prisonhood and will it have a price or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** It will be available first on iTunes in April, followed shortly by Google Play, and Facebook. It will be Free-To-Play

**Small Dev Talk: Can you give us some background on Fei Hu – your formation and the types of games you make?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** I set-up Fei Hu Interactive back in Q2 2012 with a vision to create a China-based, global-focused cross-platform game company. There is no doubt China is an export-driven country; however when it comes to brands and content, China is by-and-large an importer in my opinion. I believe it does not need to be this way as China has the right ingredients to develop and market appealing brands and content for a global audience. We developed PRISONHOOD, our inaugural franchise, to demonstrate this potential and further show China can entertain the world. Our games are intended to dramatize and exaggerate themes that you find in popular culture everywhere, such as prison, travel, gambling, etc. But regardless of the exact theme, our games need to be approachable for the masses – and for this reason, we focus on developing social free-to-play casual and mid-core games.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the attraction for you in making games?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** There are so many ways to answer this question. There’s no one answer. But I can say this. I need to love what I do. And for me, I love developing and commercializing creativity. Games fit the profile perfectly. Games provide me with an opportunity to originate creative concepts and turn these concepts into real products and services loaded with colorful characters; engaging narrative; and fun and engaging game mechanics. Having said that, I don’t pretend to know what everyone wants. And I don’t presume I will always get-it-right. But it’s truly amazing when something you created somehow manages to entertain and delight folks.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Fei Hu Interactive:** Prisonhood will be available in over 9 languages (English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese and Korean), so we expect to attract fans from all over the world given the topical and universal nature of the prison theme. When launching a new game brand with a strong story line and set of great characters such as Prisonhood, it is always exciting to see what people enjoy the most, and how they connect to the universe. I encourage all your readers to try Prisonhood for themselves.
