Haven’t you ever just wanted to go skiing and snowboarding anytime during the year? Well, you can experience the freedom and adrenaline anytime you want in SNOW, Poppermost Productions new Free-To-Play open world game. I recently got the chance to talk with Alexander Bergendahl from Poppermost Productions to find out the latest and exclusive information about SNOW. You can find more about it on their [website](http://www.snowthegame.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is SNOW?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** SNOW is the first ever free-to-play, open-world skiing and snowboarding game. Players will have the chance to test their skill and compete in a variety of specially designed events, or they may choose to explore the massive winter mountain that we have built in the Free Roam game mode.

**Small Dev Talk: Does SNOW have a story? If so, what is it about?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** We have not given SNOW a story. We want players to create their own stories by immersing themselves in the world that we are building. Each player will experience the game in a different way, whether it is through the events they compete in, that special place on the mountain they find with fun features, or through the gear they choose for their character in our in-game store. Because the SNOW experience will be so unique for each user, we felt that a story would force players down a single route. In our mind, SNOW is a place where players can do whatever they want whenever they want.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of game modes or events will this game include?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** SNOW will have three primary game modes: Free Roam, Events/Challenges and Competitions. Free Roam is, as it sounds, where you may ride around and explore the mountain, completely at will and on your own timetable. Events and Challenges are more structured game modes that will uniquely test specific skills and knowledge of the mountain. Finally, competitions are special events and challenges that have much more unique rewards are only available for a short period of time.

**Small Dev Talk: How does this game stand out from other snowboarding and skiing games?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** The truly authentic mountain experience that we have created make SNOW unique. It will be the first winter sports game to really capture the majesty and nuance of what brings so many athletes to winter sports - the breathtaking winter environment. Not only have we created these dense and realistic environments, we are also the first to allow players to explore what we have made in a completely open world. Additionally, SNOW does not pick sides between skiing and snowboarding. Games in the past have favored one or the other, but we see both sports as essential to the winter sports experience and thus a key element of SNOW.

**Small Dev Talk: One thing that has really caught people’s attention is your game uses a physics engine. Why did you choose to use a physics engine for the riding mechanics for an extreme sports game?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** Because our goal was to capture what it actually feels like to ski or snowboard on a mountain, we felt that realistic physics was absolutely key. One of our core audiences is the winter sports community, and we knew that real athletes would feel the difference between something engineered and something based on reality. It would be nearly impossible to provide this genuine experience without real physics.

**Small Dev Talk: Are the scenarios in SNOW based off of real locations or are they made up?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** SNOW’s first mountain “Sialia” is completely fictional. Instead of replicating actual mountain ranges in game, we decided to create our own mountains since it gives us the freedom to create interesting and fun terrain. Replicating something in a game is a huge challenge and in our mind doesn’t necessarily provide for a better user experience in the end. When we create the mountain, we can make sure there are plenty of great features for tricks, and also provide fantastic areas for deeper exploration to satisfy the more curious players.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of features will the user get to customize in your Character Customization?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** Players will have access to a tremendous catalogue of clothing and equipment. So far we have the following items: helmets, hats, googles, sunglasses, masks, jackets, hoodies, pants, gloves, mittens, boots, bindings, skis, poles and snowboards.

**Small Dev Talk: A couple of months ago, you got a partnership with Tom Wallisch, Tanner Hall and Russ Henshaw. What does this partnership do for you?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** Partnering with these athletes gives us a direct line into the world of freeskiing. As we fine tune the core gameplay mechanics, we rely on our athletes as experience to make sure we get it just right. Because they are at the top of their game, they know their sports best down to the finest movements. They also host their own unique events, which provides great material for SNOW. Earlier this year, Tanner Hall hosted the Tanner Hall Invitational, and we replicated the unique event feature in our game. This connection to real world events and athletes is key to the authentic experience that SNOW provides.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any plans on releasing this game for the consoles?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** We would love to get SNOW onto people’s TVs. We are currently exploring our options and will keep you posted.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you guys choose to create a sports game in CryEngine?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** CryENGINE 3 is the only game engine that gives us the tools and power to create a mountain this large and dense. It is also really flexible and has a lot of useful features, such as a full day and night cycle. For the experience we are trying to create, CryEngine was the obvious choice.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create SNOW?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** All of us on the SNOW team have a shared love for snowboarding games, but felt like no one was creating anything that took advantage of modern technology (graphics, scale etc) and development techniques. With a love for winter sports, we took inspiration from games outside the genre. We saw a massive open world in Just Cause and realistic sports mechanics in Skate and decided to put these two strengths together and bring them to the winter sports genre.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** I personally love to ride around the mountain and find new areas and lines. Every time I play, I feel like I find something new and unique. It’s a very peaceful game at its core and the Free Roam game mode is perfect for allowing players unstructured and stress free time on the mountain.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of SNOW?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** Developing the mountain was definitely a challenge. No one has ever created an open-world mountain environment this dense, so creating the workflow was a learning process. There were challenges surrounding scale, since it was hard to know just how big we should make the mountain. Reproducing the exact physics of skiing was also a challenge. I learned to ski just about when I learned how to walk, but it was still difficult to translate my real-world knowledge into the game and create an experience that felt real. There’s a lot going on behind the scenes to make the experience feel authentic!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** Keep things small. We decided to make a pretty big game, which for a small team can be very tricky. I’m lucky enough to have this opportunity to work with extremely talented developers, so we were able to achieve our vision. Taking it day by day and setting achievable goals can help the more daunting projects become more manageable.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for SNOW and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** SNOW will be free-to-play and will be released later this year. The exact release date is still under discussion - we will let you know when we know!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Alexander Bergendahl:** We appreciate the patience of our community. We have promised a lot, and as a small team of developers we are doing our best to get the game out and with all of our promised features as soon as possible. Once we know our launch plan, we will share it with everyone.

[Ben Ference](https://www.facebook.com/ben.ference): I think they need to develop this hard and port it to the X1 and PS4 as an MMO type game. I think a game like that would have an amazing community base. With Achievements and Trophies, I wouldn't want to play any other Snowboarding/Skiing game.

[Peter Seibel](https://www.facebook.com/peter.seibel.33): I snowboard, but this game looks rad. I can't wait to waist my free time playing it :)
