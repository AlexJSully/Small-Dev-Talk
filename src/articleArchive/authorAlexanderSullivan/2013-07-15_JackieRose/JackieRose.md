**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will the readers come across in “Jackie Rose: The Treasure of Captain Read Volume 1”?**

**Josh:** All sorts! You’ve got Jackie who is very driven, and doesn’t think twice about anything, to a fault. Eddie, who tends to be a voice of reason for Jackie and who also happens to have a huge crush on her. Dian, who is a bit of a mystery, and Elizabeth Read, the notorious air pirate! There is more, but I won’t spoil it all!

**Small Dev Talk: What are Jackie and Eddie like and what inspired you to create these characters?**

**Josh:** The idea of Jackie and Eddie, is having to characters that bring out the best in each other. Jackie is impulsive and easily motivated, she pushes Eddie to do things he would never do on his own. Eddie on the other hand is generally quicker to think and slower to act, he reminds Jackie that there are consequences for her actions (even though she usually doesn’t listen).
