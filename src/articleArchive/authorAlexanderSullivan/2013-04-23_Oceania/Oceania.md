Oceania is a new MMORPG coming out that lets the players create the world around them. Not long ago I got the chance to talk with the developers from Digital Engine about this new game Oceania which you can find at <http://oceania-online.com/>.

**Small Dev Talk: What is Oceania?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Oceania - MMORPG for PC.

The Oceania is a limitless fantasy world which is based on the vast expanses of the ocean. Land is represented here as a set of separate surface and flying islands of various shapes and sizes. From time to time new islands or even continents appear rising from the depths of the ocean. There are wars over new territories. For a more successful development people and elves create clans and guilds that build new cities and kingdoms, attack each other trying to invade other kingdoms to expand their borders…

The universe of Oceania is ever growing with new creatures and features. It brings together a familiar earthly plane with an undersea world and a dark realm (caverns and murky lands of eternal dusk)

**Small Dev Talk: Is there a story and if so, what is it about?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** In the days of lore, this world was a fair place, full of blooming flowers and various creatures. But one not so fine day, a great disaster struck, and the face of the earth has changed forever.

Water covered almost the entire surface, with just one rather moderately sized continent remaining. A multitude of archipelagos and islets comprised the rest of the firm ground. And, as the catastrophe has changed the planet’s magnetic field, a number of islands now floated over the planet’s surface.

Those who survived the great calamity have little by little started to colonize the strips of land all over the endless ocean. Some created new land by building artificial mounds over the shallows, others looked for newly appeared sandbars and atolls.

Elves, thanks to their wings and the ability to fly, settled the floating celestial islands. Humans, not to be outdone, used magical powers of nature to create new land and make it levitate. Of other races, little was known. Undersea dwellers seldom came to the surface, and children of darkness seemingly disappeared altogether.

Thus the new world has begun…

**Small Dev Talk: On your website, it says “based on the vast expanses of the ocean”. Will there be a focus on gameplay on the ocean itself?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Yes. The gameplay has much to do with the ocean as about half of all events and actions take place in the ocean. (For the undersea race, it’s more than a half.)

**Small Dev Talk: What type of gameplay will this game have?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** RPG.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the Live World feature Oceania has? How will it work?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Players are able to change the world and partly can be its creators.

Users can create almost any subject and they decide on their own if this subject is free or can be bought in their game character’s personal shop.

Almost any player can take part in creating and filling up the game world with their own different subjects, monsters and other stuff. Or they can create their own locations and lands which are available (or not available) to other players.

Any user can send us a request for creating and adding to the game certain custom content. We determine whether this content is useful and consistent with the game’s style and spirit. If we approve the request, the user will be sent specific requirements to the content and may create and submit it. We check if the submission fits the requirements and either add the content to the game world or send it back to the author to be modified and/or revised. According to the author’s wishes, the content may be added to the game as freely accessible to all, available for purchase from an NPC, sold at the personal shop of the author’s character, etc.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of content will the player be able to create? Will it be like Steam Workshop where they can important their own content?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Almost any kind of content. Only we decide whether or not the content should be added to the game though.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the private territories?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** A private territory is the island that the player gets at the beginning of the game. It can be a sizable area good for building a castle, founding a city and other uses. In some cases, it may be a special location purchased or created by the player. There is a possibility of conquest, although in some cases the islands won over can be only pillaged but not acquired.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be a crucial role difference between the humans and the elves? Will the players get to play both?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Certainly. Each race has its own special characteristics. Unlike humans, elves have wings and can fly, while the subaquatic pelageans breathe via gills to remain submerged, etc.

**Small Dev Talk: Oceania is said to feature other races such as vampires and underwater creatures, how will those races be played and will it have an impact on the gameplay itself?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Yes. Racial affiliation greatly affects the gameplay. Each race is special, and for each, the gameplay includes totally different features. Basically, different races are different worlds with different opportunities and functionalities.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the clan and guild system like in Oceania? Will a player be able to join both a clan and a guild?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** A clan, same as a guild, is a partnership of players with a common cause and, in some cases, may have members with different race affiliations. The distinctive feature of guilds is that they are created and exist for trade (bringing the guild members various trade bonuses) while clans are there for wars and politics (and bonuses of the same nature for the members).

**Small Dev Talk: What is PvE like in Oceania? Will it feature dungeons or instances or raids?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** Oceania will definitely feature raids and dungeons.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of PvP will be featured in Oceania?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** In addition to the usual setup, Oceania’s PvP will feature battles for the possession of cities, castles and territories held by different players and player coalitions. Clashes between clans and between races will be featured as well.

**Small Dev Talk: Being an MMO, will there be micro transaction? If so, what will we be seeing as micro transactions?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** This issue is currently being considered.

**Small Dev Talk: What unique features does your game have?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** This game has no limitations. Users have total freedom in their choice and modifications of the gameplay. They can affect Oceania’s universe, co-creating and redesigning it as they see fit.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** The range of in-game achievements, of which Oceania offers plenty.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on and does this game require high specs to play?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** This issue is better discussed after the game programming is optimized.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Oceania and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** We plan the release for this summer, although this is tentative. The game will be sold for a one-time payment and will require no monthly subscription.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the reader?**

**Eduard Digital Engine:** We hope that gamers will like Oceania’s universe and find it interesting and unusual enough to participate in its everlasting creation, which in turn will make the game even more original and engaging.

## Archived public comments

[alamantus](https://alamantus.com/): Well this game is beautiful but it didn’t get funded on Kickstarter because it suffered from severe Lame Kickstarter Video Syndrome. Lots of beautiful visuals, but an unexplained bikini-clad woman who can grow wings (??) and some quite frankly poorly done voice-overs.

At any rate, this game and the concept of an endless ocean continuously spitting up new islands is super interesting to me. And while I don’t see how this could thrive as an MMO, it definitely looks like a gorgeous display of graphics and an enormous treasure trove of possibility.
