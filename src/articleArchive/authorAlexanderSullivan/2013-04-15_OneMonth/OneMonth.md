## It Has Been 1 Month

It has been officially 1 month of Small Dev Talk and the entire team is impressed on what we have achieved in this first month. We would like to thank you, the audiences and readers as well as the companies that have participated in Small Dev Talkâ€™s interviews. We will be going through a lot of changes in the upcoming months to better your experience with us and we are wondering, what are your thoughts on Small Dev Talk? Any suggestions, comments, feedback or requests for Small Dev Talk?
