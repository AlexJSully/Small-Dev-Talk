A vacation turned wrong, an abandoned town full of mystery and terror lurking around every turn. I recently had the chance to sit down and do an interview with Rachmad Imron, one of the producers and part of Digital Happiness. Check them out at [http://digitalhappiness.net/](http://www.digitalhappiness.net/) , or the games personal site [http://dreadout.com/](http://dreadout.com/). You can also find them on facebook at [https://www.facebook.com/dreadoutgame](https://www.facebook.com/dreadoutgame).

**Small Dev Talk: What Is DreadOut?**

**Rachmad Imron:** DreadOut is a 3rd person survival horror set in a fictional setting in Indonesia. When Linda and her friends stray from their vacation, her friends start disappearing and something different happens to her as she becomes able to sense ghostly apparitions. Somehow she is able to transfer her energy through her gadget and hurt the spirits, just like the superstitious belief that photos can steal your soul.

**Small Dev Talk: What can you tell us about the main character?**

**Rachmad Imron:** Players control Linda as our main protagonist, and she uses modern gadgets at her disposal including smartphones, digital cameras, and digital video cameras. With these instruments she can interact with and capture the various kinds of unique South East Asian Ghosts that you have never seen before. We try to invent Linda similar like a Link-Zelda type (a silent type; she will not have conversation.)

**Small Dev Talk: What is the basic story of DreadOut?**

**Rachmad Imron:** It’s a little bit cheesy, basically its stereotypical students on vacation. The students adventure out and find an abandoned town, and people start acting crazy. Her friends begin to go missing…cliché is it not? We will add some twists here and there to make it more old school and epic

**Small Dev Talk: What was the inspiration behind the game?**

**Rachmad Imron:** From a game concept mechanic DreadOut is kind of a love letter to Fatal Frame. In regards to gameplay there are a lot of games that inspired us such as Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Haunting Ground, Clock Tower, forbidden siren and Castlevania. Some asian horror movies that inspired us are; Ju-On, Dark Water, Ringu, Shutter,Indonesian Classic horror movie "Beranak dalam kubur", Guillermo Del Toro el Espinaza del diablo and Satanico Pandemonium.

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of equipment will be available for the players in the game?**

**Rachmad Imron:** An Iris Phone, DSLR, and a digital video camera

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of creatures should the player be expecting along his journey?**

**Rachmad Imron:** Some of the ghosts may seem identical to the typical Asian female ghost with long black hair. However many of the ghosts will be very unique and based on legend and lore in Indonesia such as Pocong and Palasik.

**Small Dev Talk: Is the game a free roam layout or a set story line path?**

**Rachmad Imron:** Basically the game would be linear story driven with multiple possible endings. The player will have the option to back track to find others clue and ghosts. We also try to implement free roam - random ghost - "ghost hunting" mode
