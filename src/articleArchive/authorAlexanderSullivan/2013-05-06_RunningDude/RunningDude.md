RUN DUDE RUN! Experience the adventurous run of this dude in Running Dude by Panin Games. Not long ago I got the chance to talk with the developer of Running Dude and the leader of Panin Games, Serjey Panin and their upcoming PC version of Running Dude. You can check out their game at [http://www.paningames.com/](http://www.paningames.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** Running dude is a 2D platformer based on the Mario gameplay. The main idea of the game is to run away from the enemies which are chasing you (a bit like temple run). The game is going to have a time rewinding technique which will add a lot of puzzles to the game (I got the idea from a game called Braid). In some cases the player won’t have to use the time rewind technique which makes the game even more fun because even when you complete the whole game, you will still find it fun to complete it again because there are about 5 or 6 ways to complete each level, therefore every time you complete the game you will get a completely new gaming experience.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** If you play the game the first time it might seem that the game doesn’t really have a story which is a mistake. I must say that the game doesn’t tell you the story like in most games nowadays. Most of the easter eggs which are added to the game are there to help you understand the story.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of obstacles will we see in Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** There are going to be a lot of types of obstacles such as lava, enemies on the ground, flying enemies and obviously enemies chasing the player. At the moment the enemies which are chasing the player are represented by red cubes (as you can see in the trailer). The look of enemies chasing you is going to change very soon as the game is not 100% ready.

**Small Dev Talk: How can the ‘Rewind Time’ feature come to the player’s advantage and why did you choose to add that feature?**

**Serjey Panin:** The time rewind feature is more of a “Have fun” feature. As I said earlier time rewind technique is there for 2 reasons. The first reason is to add more puzzles and levels where you have to think how to complete them and the second reason is to add more different ways of completing the level (as well as finding lots of easter eggs in the game). On some levels the time rewind feature has to be used due to the types of enemies on the way. Some enemies won’t care about the time rewind technique therefore it allows the player to solve some puzzles.

**Small Dev Talk: The trailer for the game says “You got a choice”, what choices can the player make?**

**Serjey Panin:** During first 5 or 6 levels the gameplay is pretty linear. The reason for this is to get the player ready for challenges and difficulties ahead of him. Starting with level 7 the gameplay gets more complicated therefore the player never gets bored due to the different features the game keeps adding.(good example of this is the time rewind feature which first appears at level 10) Starting with level 12 the player gets a choice for the first time in the game. From there, the choices the player can make keep expending until the very end of the game.

**Small Dev Talk: The character you play as in Running Dude appears to have some abilities. What abilities will the player get to use in Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** The character gets a few abilities such as (obviously running and jumping) double jump, umbrella which allows running dude to slow himself down in the air, double speed which makes him twice as fast, time rewind which allows him to rewind time, wall jump which allows him to jump from one wall to another and fire grenades which help him to destroy the enemies on the ground.

**Small Dev Talk: What creatures will the come across in Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** As I mentioned earlier on the main creatures the player will come across in the game are going to be enemies. At the moment enemies which are chasing the player are represented by red cubes because the game is still under development. Another type of enemies the player will see in the game are ground enemies which kill the player after 3 touches and can be destroyed by fire grenades which the player is going to have as a standard weapon.

**Small Dev Talk: Will you be adding any multiplayer features to Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** Yes, definitely. I think that multiplayer is going to have a big impact on the game. The game is going to have a single player as well, but in my opinion playing running dude with your friends (or even random people you meet on the server) is a completely new experience of the same game. There are going to be 3 different types of multiplayer such as “Race” which is a race between two players and seeing who can complete the level first and get the highest score. The second type still doesn’t have a proper name for it, but the idea of it is to make one player play as running dude and the second player as the enemies. That makes the game a bit more strategic oriented because the 2nd player has to be in charge of all the enemies such as ground enemies and the enemies which are chasing the 1-st player. The first player has got a limited amount of time rewind power (in single player it’s not limited) which allows him to think when to use the power against the 2nd player. Right now I can’t tell you anything about the third type of multiplayer because i want to keep it as a secret for the time being.

**Small Dev Talk: What new features will you plan on adding to the PC version of Running Dude that Running Capsule did not have?**

**Serjey Panin:** You must not forget that “Running dude” and “Running capsule” are one the same game. “Running dude” is the updated version of “Running capsule” and it contains a lot of interesting features that “Running capsule” did not have such as new levels, new character, new enemies, power ups (such as double speed), easter eggs and secret levels, multiplayer, better menu, improved graphics, new types of obstacles and many more things. The PC version of the game is going to have about 25 more levels then the mobile version and also it is going to have much better graphics and design. I’m now also planning to publish the game on to PlayStation network and Xbox live as the game plays very well using the joystick.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** In my opinion to be a good game developer you also have to be a gamer because if you don’t play games you won’t know how to create a good game. So as a gamer I really like Super Mario Bros. When I was making “Running dude” I was also trying to add some Mario atmosphere into the game. I think that Mario is a very good platformer, but the best thing about Mario in my opinion is the positive atmosphere the player has when he plays it. That’s what I've tried to add to my game.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Running Dude?**

**Serjey Panin:** My favourite aspect of running dude is definitely the time rewind feature. I think it’s really good fun just to mess around with it after you completed the whole game and also it gives you more ways of completing different levels.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Running Dude and how did you overcome them?**

**Serjey Panin:** That is a very good question. I think the whole development process was a challenge itself already. There were so many challenges that I’ve even lost the count now. I guess the biggest challenge was to keep on believing in the game and just keep working for the success. Some challenges we had were pretty hard to overcome, but we made it and hopefully will properly release the game very soon.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Serjey Panin:** The game runs on Unity 3D game engine.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Serjey Panin:** The only advice I have is believe in yourself and the game you are making. Don’t let the bad comments about your game blind you and make you not being able to see the good side of it. On the other hand don’t let the good things about your game make you not being able to see the bad side of it.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Running Dude PC version and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Serjey Panin:** I can’t really tell you anything about the expected launch of the PC version (as well as Xbox and PlayStation versions) because I’m still not sure myself. There are still a lot of bugs in the game which are needed to be fixed therefore it might take some time to finish the game completely. The only thing I can tell you now is that the PC version is going to come out much earlier than the Xbox and PlayStation versions. There are going to be 2 versions of the game. (“Running dude” and “Running dude: premium edition”) The standard version is going to be free to play while the premium one will be paid and going to cost about 1 dollar. Premium edition is going to include some new levels, characters and one extra multiplayer type.

**Small Dev Talk: How much success have you made on the android version of Running Dude and what have you learned since you released it?**

**Serjey Panin:** After I first released running dude on android, my web site was visited by over a million people! The release of the game on Google Play was just a test release to see how it all works. That is the reason why I still haven’t even changed the name of the game on Google Play. My next release is going to be the proper launch of “Running dude” on PC, android, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and maybe even PlayStation 4!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Serjey Panin:** If you want to become an independent game developer then you must believe in yourself and believe that your game is going to be a success! Also learn some programming and just do your best. Thank you very much for having an interview with me.
