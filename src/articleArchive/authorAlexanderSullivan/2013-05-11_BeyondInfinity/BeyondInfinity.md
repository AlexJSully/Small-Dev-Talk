Have you ever wanted to take a mathematical adventure? Haven’t you ever wondered what the personalities of 3, 61, 69 and 313 would be? Well now you can with the upcoming novel by Charles Fischer, Beyond Infinity. Not long ago I got the chance to talk with the author behind Beyond Infinity which you can support at [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/504814430/beyond-infinity-a-mathematical-adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/504814430/beyond-infinity-a-mathematical-adventure) or check out the official website at [www.BeyondInfinityBook.com](http://beyondinfinitybook.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** Beyond Infinity is Young Adult adventure/mystery novel that explores the fascinating and exciting side of mathematics.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** The story centers around high school senior Matthew “MatheMatt” Forsythe who discovers a strange computer and a secret door in his school. Determined to find out more, he and his friends devise a scheme to crack the code…and find much more than they were expecting. Matt and his friend, Kelsie, stumble upon an adventure that takes them through a mysterious teleportal, where they encounter numbers as living entities. They meet a mysterious stranger who claims that the world is coming to an end because numbers are missing or dying off. After a grueling mathematics ordeal, he and Kelsie try to rescue specific numbers like 8, 61 and 313. However, they quickly realize that they may have made a few mistakes along the way…

**Small Dev Talk: What is a mathematical adventure and how is Beyond Infinity a mathematical adventure?**

**Charles Fischer:** This mathematical adventure is really an adventure into mathematics. Math for many students up through at least 10th grade can seem like an endless repetition of arithmetical operations. However, the entire realm of mathematics reaches far, far beyond basic arithmetic. In the standard progression of mathematics, we have arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and calculus. Beyond that, we have Beyond Infinity, whichsupplements these standards by adding interesting puzzles, fascinating facts, and what mathematicians call number theory.

For example, what does the number 7 actually mean? What is it as a thing, as a being? If the number 7 walked up to you and introduced itself, how would it be similar or different than the number 8? What are the personalities of various numbers? This is a true adventure of thought…

**Small Dev Talk: What math concepts will you be applying into Beyond Infinity and how? Will we be seeing the Fibonacci sequence and its applications to natural life or the intriguing aspects of the golden ratio?**

**Charles Fischer:** There are a lot of concepts that made their way into the final draft, even though I had to leave out quite a few. The Golden Mean, the Fibonacci Sequence, the Padovan Sequence and other patterns remained. So yes, there are some interesting applications in the novel. There are also concepts like happy and unhappy numbers, different types of even numbers, fractals, highly composite numbers, and more.

A big part of the novel is about numbers themselves. Many numbers make “guest appearances” throughout the story: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 57, 61, 153, and 313 to name a few. Each number is a personality, so the key is to learn the traits of each one…

**Small Dev Talk: What is the character Matthew, like? What inspired you to write him? Was there ever a student that inspired you to create certain traits of this character?**

**Charles Fischer:** Matthew is a geek in the positive sense. He loves learning about math and has a habit of collecting tidbits of information about various numbers. He actually collects examples of how numbers are found in the real world. Because I am a teacher, many of my characters are amalgamations of students I have taught over the years. So, Matt’s character is really a combination of a few students that I have taught over the years.

**Small Dev Talk: How do you plan on making this novel enjoyable towards students?**

**Charles Fischer:** I incorporated QR Codes throughout the text so that students can actually get involved in the learning process. The idea is that students can stop the reading process periodically and add their own examples to what Matt is thinking about, for example, what the number 7 could possibly mean. It is my hope that readers everywhere will get get psyched about providing their own examples about how numbers show up in their lives.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** The initial inspiration for Beyond Infinity actually came from a dream that I had about eight years ago. After that, much of the inspirational experiences came from teaching middle school mathematics and language arts and seeing what excited and inspired my students. I feel strongly that learning should be an enjoyable experience and Beyond Infinity is, hopefully, one of my contributions.

**Small Dev Talk: Has your teaching career ever positively or negatively affected your writing on Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** Yeah, I have to think that all of my teaching experiences positively affected my writing. When you have to teach students “how to write,” you inevitably learn A LOT along the way. The saying “You don’t really know something until you teach it” comes to mind. I can’t think of any negative examples, mainly because I consider making mistakes a positive thing. We learn more from our mistakes than we do from our successes, something I wish teachers and students everywhere would appreciate more.

**Small Dev Talk: Are you trying to bring any moral or meaning from your novel?**

**Charles Fischer:** There is not a specific moral to this novel, but there is a specific purpose. From the beginning, I intended to help students appreciate the many other aspects of numbers and mathematics.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** I love the QR codes and the idea that readers can get directly involved in going beyond the novel. It is my hope that readers will “catch the way” of collecting examples of numbers. As an example, I hope that readers will start their own collections of where they see numbers in their lives. 4 example: there are 4 seasons, 4 main U.S. Sports, 4 temperaments, 4 directions, 4 oceans (sometimes 5 or 3), 4 states of matter and many more. What do these examples say about the number 4?

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you come across in the writing of Beyond Infinity and how did you overcome them?**

**Charles Fischer:** The biggest challenge was just finishing. I started writing Beyond Infinity seven years ago and, like many other authors I’m sure, I went through numerous variations and drafts and definitely had trouble finishing. I participated in National Novel Writing Month (November) a few times in order to crank out a quantity of words in a timely manner and then I usually spent the following months editing and revising what I had just written. I found out over the years that I need to write in focused chunks and then sit back for while reflecting on what I just accomplished.

Finding the right balance between the storyline and the mathematics was a huge challenge. I ended up taking out about 50 pages of material so that the plot could move along better and faster. It’s painful to take out material, but I’ll find a way to use it, perhaps on the website. I almost quit writing Beyond Infinity when a trusted friend told me that I should have just written a non-fiction book. But I held on to the idea that the novel could still connect with certain readers and I just kept going.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming writers?**

**Charles Fischer:** Just keep writing. Self-doubt is probably the worst enemy for many writers. No matter what your story is, there are people somewhere in the world who want to hear it. The whole world is a market now, so get your message out there in as many ways as possible and connect to your fans. I never expected to have to learn so much about social media and marketing. Writing a novel is the “easy” part; connecting with an audience is much, much harder.

Start your social media NOW. I have learned a lot recently about building a “platform” and I wish I had started years ago with this novel. My best advice is start giving away at least pieces of your material and build an audience. Writing is becoming a collaborative process, so get other people involved in reading, commenting and adding to your writing. For my next novel, I will be getting people more involved in the process much earlier.

Always keep learning. I am always amazed at how much there is to learn in this world. Just recently, I took a few evening classes about writing and learned a lot from a screenwriter. Writing is creating. Writing is giving birth. We might give birth to a novel, but then we still have to raise it. There is a lot to be done after the book is finished. Don’t be discouraged, but understand that writing a novel is only a small part of the entire process, especially if you have an important message.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for Beyond Infinity?**

**Charles Fischer:** If my Kickstarter campaign is successful, I expect a soft release in July and a full release mid-August. Otherwise, the dates will be pushed to October.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Charles Fischer:** I wrote the novel to get people more excited and interested in numbers and mathematics, so please get involved in the conversation! The website is [www.BeyondInfinityBook.com](http://beyondinfinitybook.com/) and it will be a place where people can share their cool ideas and interesting facts.
