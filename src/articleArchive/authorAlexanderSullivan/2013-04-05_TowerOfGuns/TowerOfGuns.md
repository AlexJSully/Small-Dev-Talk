I recently got the chance to talk with the Joe Mirabello ([@blankslatejoe](https://twitter.com/blankslatejoe)) from Terrible Posture Games on their new, innovative and uniquely looking game, Tower of Guns. A fast pace first person shooter which can you find at [http://www.towerofguns.com/](http://www.towerofguns.com/) and support for Steam Greenlight at [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=132007077](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=132007077)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Tower of Guns is a roguelike-like first-person shooter (yes, that’s two “likes” it’s a term borrowed from the game FTL). It’s a kind of like what FTL or Binding of Isaac might be if it were mixed with Quake or Doom 2. There’s a lot of fast action and crazy twitch based gameplay, but a lot of randomization and other elements that keep it replayable.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Get to the top of the Tower! Actually, the plot itself isn’t something I’m talking about so much yet, as I’m experimenting with some pretty goofy ideas and I’m not sure if they’ll prove to be much fun, so I don’t want to over-promise :)

**Small Dev Talk: What is gameplay like in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** The gameplay has a lot in common with the earlier generations of FPS games like Quake, Doom2, Dark Forces, Serious Sam. There’s a lot of fast, twitch action in large spaces with very few mechanics to slow you down: no crouching, going prone, sticky cover or iron sights-—instead Tower of Guns is all about dodging, circle strafing, and running at super-fast speeds. The actual game should only take an hour or so to beat–if you win—-but it’s the kind of game that’s going to take many, many, many tries TO beat.

**Small Dev Talk: Is this a linear game or will it be open-world?**

**Joe Mirabello:** While I love open-world games, Tower of Guns is much more arcade-y. It’s not purely a linear corridor shooter, as some of the arenas are quite sprawling, but it’s certainly not like Skyrim or anything. You won’t clock 400 hours on Steam exploring nooks and crannies, but I’d like to think I’ll still be able to give people their money’s worth.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of game modes will be included in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Right now there’s just the normal campaign mode. I’ve got some ideas for further game modes, but it really depends on how much time I have.

**Small Dev Talk: One of Tower of Gun’s key features is the always fresh experience making each time you play random. How is that being implemented into your game?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Sadly, I’m just one developer, so I have to cut a lot of corners, which is a shame. Right now the randomization for arenas is based off of a “pool” of allowable sublevels, and each stage of the game is a six or seven chamber string of arenas ‘composites’ from that pool on load. So it’s not procedural. It’s a poor-man’s randomization, but it also focuses on my strengths, which are constructing the environments themselves. I’ve gotten pretty fast at that. Also, this doesn’t mean that the chambers are that easy to memorize either, as each chamber also has a number of different enemy layouts, which themselves have a lot of randomization in the spawning variety and location. There’s plenty of other random elements as well too: the placement and kinds of pickups, the way shops are handled, what kinds of loot gets dropped from killed enemies, and which boss awaits you at the end of each stage. And, aside from the randomization, there are plenty of weapons and perks to unlock as you go too.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the class options in Tower of Guns? Can you describe to role of each class for us?**

**Joe Mirabello:** The mechanical purpose of 'classes’ in games is that they are supposed to alter the way in which you play the game; a warrior gets close up to fight, a hunter relies on bows/distance attacks, etc. Those kinds of conventional 'class’ trappings don’t fit in with the style gameplay of Tower of Guns, however what DOES affect the way-you-play-the-game in a similar fashion are the guns themselves.

So, that said, similar to how you would unlock ships in FTL or how you might unlock classes in a more traditional roguelike, you unlock guns in Tower of Guns. How you play the game with a shotgun is very different than how you play with a saw blade launcher, but both can be advantageous in different circumstances.

Additionally you can couple a gun choice with a 'perk’ at the beginning of each run attempt, and many of those are mobility based. Some perks can make it so you take no fall-damage; others make you move twice as fast, or double-jump without the need to find a jump-upgrade. You can mix and match perks and guns and creates some nice variety in how you play the game.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of weapons will the player expected to see included in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** I’ve built about ten weapons and rigged/animated them but I’ve only properly balanced two so far, so this is something I’m not talking about too much as I’m not certain which ones will be 'fun’ enough to make the final cut. :)

**Small Dev Talk: What type of gun modifications will you include in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Think of it like this: in Tower of Guns each gun has one major inherent quality: a shotgun has spread; a rocket launcher has AOE, etc.

Most of those 'qualities’ are ALSO available as pickups in the game, and each gun has a 'slot’ which can hold second quality. So if you have a rocket launcher and you pick up a shotgun modification then you have a
rocket-launcher that shoots out ten rockets in a spread fashion. The qualities I’m pretty sure are making the cut are 'shotgun’, 'rapid-fire’, and 'explosive’, but there’s about six others I’m still toying with. It’ll really depend on how much fun I can make them.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of enemies will the player come across in Tower of guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Well, there’s a huge variety in turrets—gigantic arrays of bullet-launchers, spike-ball launchers, bomb throwers, saw blade shooters, and the like. There’s also a lot of stuff that charges at you and blows up, because that was pretty easy to make. There are some pretty stupid hover-style bots like the spin-bot and bomb-bomb that, while not too dangerous on their own, tend to come in packs and sneak up on you.

Additionally there are the more difficult enemies like the Grinder and the Angler-bot, but I’m not talking about them much yet.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of environments will the users be playing in?**

**Joe Mirabello:** The players will be inside the Tower the entire time. That said, I try and do a lot with the lighting and layout to make each stage feel a little different. I’ve been toying with whether or not to have windows or let the player move outside the tower, and while that’s pretty easy art wise, it’s difficult to do without compromising my desire to make it so the player can travel anywhere they can see, so it might have to be reserved for a sequel.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose a cartoonish-art like feel for the graphics in Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Believe it or not, it’s entirely a time-issue. The art style is made that way because I can make it fast. I can reuse a lot of the textures from one piece to another and I can build levels super speedily. The art is almost 'abstracted’ from the level layout in a sense, which is a very old-school FPS approach too. But as a single developer, I have to think very critically of how I was going to spend my time. Perhaps in my next project I’ll have the luxury of spending more time on the art and I’ll feel less like it was an “aesthetic compromise”. :)

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be a multiplayer in Tower of Guns? If so, what type of game modes will there be?**

**Joe Mirabello:** I’d LOVE to add multiplayer. A Co-OP roguelike-like FPS would be hilarious fun. However, that’s not a particularly easy thing to just “add in”…and I’m not sure my technical skills are up to it yet. Perhaps once I finish ToG I’ll have learned enough to give it a try in whatever follow-up project I work on, assuming ToG does well enough to keep me working on my own and I don’t have to return to working for a bigger studio.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** The FPS genre was what got me into making games…the first game I modded was LucasArts’ Dark Forces, and I grew up on games like Quake, Thief, and Deus Ex. But when I finally got good enough to break into the games industry professionally I found myself working on action-RPGs and MMOs. I still wanted to work on an FPS…but the big-budget FPS of today is slower, more linear, and more calculated and their “lore” tends to be more realistic and cinematic. It’s a different genre now, and while there are certainly good games among this new breed, I felt like it was worth revisiting some of the more neglected aspects of the FPS genre.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Joe Mirabello:** That’s a hard question, as whatever I’ve added most recently is probably my favorite aspect…but I think there’s something in ToG that’s been pretty consistent since day one: people are never quite sure what to expect. That quality, the delight of discovering something new, is what keeps the play testers engaged, and so it’s probably my favorite aspect of the game.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Tower of Guns?**

**Joe Mirabello:** Well, for the “team” there really is just me. I do get some sound support from existing libraries and such, and my brother is authoring the music, but I still implement all that stuff into the game. So, juggling all the coding, art, animation, level design, UI, marketing, that’s a challenge. I knew a lot about making games beforehand, but part of why I’m doing this is to learn a lot more about those aspects of game development to which I was previously ignorant. Something like marketing is a really new adventure to me, but being a one-person studio means I can make mistakes as I go since the only person I let down is myself. Fortunately, I learn pretty quickly.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Joe Mirabello:** It’s probably premature to ask me this now. I wouldn’t take advice from a solo developer who hasn’t yet finished their project, even if they –have– worked for years professionally prior to going solo, as I have. If I ship the game and it does pretty well, then maybe I’ll know something worth sharing. : )

**Small Dev Talk: What engine is Tower of Guns using?**

**Joe Mirabello:** It’s using UDK, which is based off of UE3. I’d used UE3 for years prior at 38 Studios, and was very familiar with the engine, and thus was able to hit the ground running when I went solo.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Tower of Guns and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Joe Mirabello:** My official due date is “before the new thief game comes out.” I love that series so much, and I want to be able to play it guiltless-ly when it comes out! As for cost: I very much doubt that it’ll be free to play. However, I also can’t see changing a full triple-A price for the game, since it is smaller in scope and, in the end, was made by just one guy.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**
