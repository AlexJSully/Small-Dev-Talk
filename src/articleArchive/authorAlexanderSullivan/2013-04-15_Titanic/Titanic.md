Have you ever wanted to explore the famous R.M.S. Titanic? Well, now you can with the new and exciting game, Titanic: Honor and Glory. Not long ago, I got the chance to talk with the Tom Lynskey from Four Funnel Entertainment, the project manager and director of Titanic: Honor and Glory. You can check out the game at their official website here [http://titanic-honor-and-glory.tumblr.com/](https://titanic-honor-and-glory.tumblr.com/) and/or support them on their [indiegogo here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/titanic-honor-and-glory-phase-2?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sasdeep&utm_content=link&sscid=61k3_afhnf#/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** “Titanic: Honor and Glory” is a video game on the CryEngine 3. In short, it’s Sherlock Holmes on the Titanic, in a way.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** While I can’t go into too much detail about the game’s story, it’s pretty much the following. At the moment, this early in the development, some details may change. The protagonist - Owen “Robert” Morgan is on a train from London’s Waterloo Station bound for Southampton, England. Reading the newspaper, two things are revealed: A jewel thief who recently robbed the British Museum is still on the loose and suspected to be fleeing the country, and also that today is the departure of the famous RMS Titanic on her maiden voyage from Southampton. Scotland Yard is aboard the train looking for the thief with the idea that he may be on board and planning to board a ship in Southampton’s harbor to escape to America. Upon finding the player, the inspectors interrogate and wrongfully arrest Robert, thinking he’s the thief, when he is not. At Southampton, the player manages to break away and make his way to the harbors, discovering that due to a coal strike, Titanic is the only departure, and there for the thief must be aboard. Robert’s only hope to clear his own name is to board the Titanic and find the real villain. With the help of historical figures and famous Titanic names, the player must find this man while experiencing the life aboard history’s grandest ocean liner. But, just a few days into the voyage, disaster strikes, and the player must complete his mission and fight for his life as the entire ship sinks in real time.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you create a game based on the famous Titanic?**

**Tom Lynskey:** While of course, with this game we want to entertain people and give them an exciting virtual experience, we really want people to understand what the true story of the Titanic was and how significant the disaster is even today. A sad number of people today haven’t even realized that the Titanic is a real disaster that occurred 100 years ago, and instead think it’s a work of fiction from Hollywood film makers. Our team is full of talented artists and programmers, but an important fact about our crew is that we are all also historians about the ship. We know and love the history behind it, and what we don’t know, we have consultants on our team for. Some of these consultants have been to the wreck, some have written countless books about it, and some have names that any historian would recognize. When we decide to create a video game together, of course it would be about the Titanic.

**Small Dev Talk: How much of an exact replica are you creating to the R.M.S Titanic that sunk in 1912?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Our in-game Titanic is going to be 100% of the ship. You can explore every single cabin, enter crew areas, walk through the coal bunkers and fireman’s passages, and even climb the masts. The whole ship is accessible- at least in tour mode. We are creating every part of the ship to be as faithful to the original as possible. From all the texture patterns and tiles to the exact words printed on signs. We’ve looked at every public photo of the ship and her nearly identical sister ship, Olympic, as well as countless other ships by the same company. On top of that, our team includes some of the men who know the ship better than anyone alive. The ship in our game will be as close to the original Titanic as humanly possible.

**Small Dev Talk: Will the Titanic in your game sink just like the real R.M.S. Titanic?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Yup. It’ll sink in real time. You’ll have goals and objectives as it founders, and you’ll be able to experience some of the famous stories told by survivors. For the first time in a Titanic game, you’ll get to race through flooding corridors or help passengers get to the lifeboats.

**Small Dev Talk: How much will your game match the historic R.M.S. Titanic? Will it have real-life passengers that were on the Titanic as well as exact time the Titanic sunk?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Our main story- about the jewel thief- is pure fiction. However, it will be heavily influenced by the rest of the true story of the Titanic, as if the story was added right into the authentic tale of the ship. As of now, the only fictional characters on the ship will be the player and the villain. And yes, it will sink in real time. The massive virtual world we’re building for this will go from fully explorable to completely destroyed and flooded in 2 hours and 40 minutes of gameplay. You’ll of course be able to pause, quit, save your game, etc, to break up that time if you’re legs get restless or nature calls.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of gameplay will Titanic Honor and Glory feature?**

**Tom Lynskey:** “Titanic: Honor and Glory” will feature tour mode, where one can explore the ship with no locked doors and no objectives. Story mode is where the action is at. This won’t be fully free roam, as passengers and crew will have locked off areas, and you’ll be separated by classes, but generally, most parts of the ship will be accessed at some point in the story. Story mode will be linear during the voyage- you’ll have things you have to do to get to later parts of the game. However, when it’s sinking, the game opens up with freedom, and you can do what you want, almost like an action packed version of tour mode.

**Small Dev Talk: What will you be able to do in the explorer mode in Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** You can explore the whole ship and get a feel for what the ship was like, as well as access all the other models in the game, such as docks and other ships (which won’t be as explorable as the Titanic is).

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be any multiplayer in Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** This is something we’re undecided about at the moment. We have the ability to do it, but the goal is now to find a way to make multiplayer worthwhile for the player.

**Small Dev Talk: Was there any content inspired from James Cameron’s movie, Titanic?**

**Tom Lynskey:** We loved the film Titanic by Cameron, as well as his documentaries and other works. It was the most impressive recreation of the Titanic to date. Naturally, yes, the size of it was grand- he built a full scale, sinkable model of parts of the ship! But, what was impressive to us was the authenticity that went into his sets, and they really brought those old black and white photos everyone has seen to life in some truly authentic recreations. We also loved other Titanic films- A Night to Remember (1958), SOS Titanic (1979), and The Last Signals (2012), and we’ll more than likely throw in little references to all of them. But, no, we won’t be having any major elements in the game inspired by any of the films.

**Small Dev Talk: Will the players get to interact and meet with the famous characters from the Titanic movie, Jack and Rose?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Nah, despite the fact that they had quite an adventure themselves, neither Jack nor Rose nor Rose’s nakedness will be making an appearance in the game.

**Small Dev Talk What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Tom Lynskey:** I ran this question by the rest of the team to get their opinions, and most said that they like the ship itself and the different parts, but to be completely honest, I personally am looking forward to the other stuff in the game. Any game about the Titanic will have the ship itself. But, our game features so much more than just the R.M.S. Titanic. We also will include parts of Southampton, England, the train there, the SS Nomadic, and the Carpathia, among other things. It’s these features that excite me, as they are what make this unique, and what turns the game from just a game aboard the Titanic to an entire historical experience.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Oh…. so many challenges. A lot of it was technical, and quite a few headaches with equipment, but I think the most unique challenge we’ve had so far was dealing with some former team members. We’re working on separate projects now, but they have been taking models from us and others and passing them as their own, spreading rumors about us, in addition to threats. They have more copyright infringement issues than they can handle though (not just with us), and they aren’t really going anywhere. We wish them luck, but we’d really like them to get out of our hair and stop stealing our work!

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on? Does it require high specs to play?**

**Tom Lynskey:** The game will run on the CryEngine 3. At the moment, it requires high specs, but we speculate that by the time the game is released, these specs will be standard, and well in the range of what most gamers have. One of the other features we are looking to implement into this game is the new “Oculus Rift” technology, which will allow the player to wear a headset, providing a full field of view immersion into the game. This will bring the luxuries of the ship to life, and really intensify the sinking!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Tom Lynskey:** Game technology is developing to a point where nearly anything is possible if done right. I’ve played games since the N64 came out (and recently restored mine- was just playing Goldeneye 64 an hour ago!), and all the way since the first game until now, it’s been limited what can be done due to technology. But now, we’re at the point where even the Titanic is possible. Find the right team, and let your imaginations run wild.

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like being the project manager and director of Titanic Honor and Glory?**

**Tom Lynskey:** While this is currently the only game our team is working on, it isn’t the only project I’m doing at the moment. I make films for a living, and am busy with a lot of those as well, and I’m in a very serious relationship with the love of my life… who unfortunately at the moment lives on the other side of the world. With traveling to be with her, these side projects, and “Titanic: Honor and Glory”, it’s busy. It’s very busy. I love it though- it’s a wonderful experience working with every one and seeing the ship come to life, and I can’t wait to get to the later stages!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Titanic Honor and Glory and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Tom Lynskey:** We hope to release it around the Titanic’s 104th anniversary in 2016. It would be for sale, with its price comparable to other games- roughly in the $50-$60 range.
