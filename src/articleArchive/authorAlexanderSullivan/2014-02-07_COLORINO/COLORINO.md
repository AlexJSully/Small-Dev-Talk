**Small Dev Talk: How do you play COLORNIO? What is the objective of COLORNIO?**

**Small Dev Talk: What power-ups will there be in COLORNIO and how does it impact the gameplay?**

**Alex Probst:** We have 3 power ups so far, probably will have more in the future. Some will be able to be stored to use strategically when needed, others will remain on the game screen.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of enemies will there be in COLORNIO and what do they do?**

**Alex Probst:** All enemies will be disruptive and destructive. Some will multiply and “eat up” spaces, narrowing you chances of success. Other will render blocks unmovable and others will change the colors on the squares.

**Small Dev Talk: On your Kickstarter, you say there are 250 initial levels, how many levels do you plan on having when COLORNIO is released?**

**Small Dev Talk: What will the differences be between these levels?**

**Alex Probst:** The type of blocks, the amount of colors present, the enemies, the objectives to reach, the layout of the grid will also change.

**Small Dev Talk: What OS’s will COLORNIO be available on? Do you plan on making a PC version of COLORNIO?**

**Alex Probst:** We’ll release it initially for iOS and Android, for phones and tablets, but will work on the desktop and probably browser versions ASAP.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create COLORNIO?**

**Alex Probst:** I love puzzle games, my wife loves puzzle games, we got hooked on many, finally came to candy crush and I was always thinking on ways to make the game play better, more strategic and less dependent on luck. So I decided to make a game I would really enjoy playing.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of COLORNIO?**

**Alex Probst:** First for me was the task of finding a programmer, took me some time, many emails, lots of people that sounded a bit dodgy and not trust worthy… finally met Pete from Australia, really down to earth guy, very talented, open minded and fast and fun to work with.. after that, it’s just been working on the game and the [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/colorino/colorino-the-colorful-puzzle-game). The challenges will arise when we launch the game!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming developers?**

**Alex Probst:** Do the game you want to play but make sure to be open to other people’s opinions. It’s hard but the rewards are big!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for COLORNIO and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Alex Probst:** Mid April, free download and IAP’s for reaching new levels more fast, power ups, extra lives…

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Alex Probst:** Support our [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/colorino/colorino-the-colorful-puzzle-game), support our game, we will do the same for you and hope you enjoy it when you play.
