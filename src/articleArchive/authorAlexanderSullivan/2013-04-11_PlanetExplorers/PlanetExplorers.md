Planet Explorers is an exciting new voxel based game. It is an RPG where you build your environments and play through an exciting and adventurous world! Recently, I got the chance to talk with the Director of Planet Explorers at Pathea Games, Zifei, to see what we, the players, will expect to see come from this innovative game. You can check out the game at [http://pathea.net/planet-explorers](http://pathea.net/planet-explorers) or support it on [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1757963851/planet-explorers) and [Steam Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129199308).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** Planet Explorers is a marching cubes voxel based open world sandbox adventure RPG. The marching cubes algorithm allows the game to have deformable terrain but have a smooth look at the same time. The game mixes elements from many genres into one adventure, thus allowing the player to have a significant amount of freedom. We've also included a very robust creations system in game where the player can create a lot of tools, vehicles, and objects. The game also features a very consistent and believable alien world, featuring strange fauna and wildlife, offering a deep immersion for the player.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** The story mode is the core part of the game, it features a story of how the first colony ship to arrive at the planet Maria in the Epsilon Indi Star System from the Sol System crashes mysteriously when it was entering the atmosphere. Some of the people escaped in time on lifeboats, others didn’t. Now, the player will play as one of the survivors, and it’ll be up to him to ensure the survival of the colonists through whatever means necessary, such as farming, building a settlement, training NPCs to be militia, etc. These gameplay functions will still be available in the adventure mode, just that there won’t be a story that’s weaving through the actions.

**Small Dev Talk: Having the name Planet Explorers gives the player an expectation that this game will have a lot of environments. What type of environments will the players encounter in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** There are many different biomes in Planet Explorers, we tried to fit in as many as possible. Most of the areas are very distinct, they include grassland, forest, rain forest, swamp, redstone, mountain, desert, underwater, sub terrain, and volcanic…so far.

**Small Dev Talk: How big is the world in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** The overall map is around 17X8km. It is pretty big! Right now there are some problems with it being too big, such as walking distances between missions. But, we designed it with planes and vehicles in mind.

**Small Dev Talk: In the single player game mode, you feature the ability to keep peace or make war with aliens. How does that work?**

**Zifei:** Well, that part of the gameplay is still in initial designing phase, but we plan to let the player directly interact with emissaries from the aliens. They might ask you to give them some tech or good in return for the good relations.

**Small Dev Talk: In Planet Explorers, you can build your surroundings. What can you specifically build? What type of buildings?**

**Zifei:** There are 2 types of building types in Planet Explorers, prefabs and player built. Prefabs are predetermined buildings such as the control center, storage, power station, and living quarters. Player build whatever the player wants to build, be it walls, skyscrapers, or just a small cottage.

**Small Dev Talk: How does owning a settlement work in Planet Explorers? How can you interact with the NPCs?**

**Zifei:** First of all, all buildings need to be built on flat ground, so the player will need to flatten out the area that he wants the building on. The control center is the prerequisite for most of the replicable building prefabs. It comes with a shield that can be upgraded to a longer radius. The shield keeps the normal animals out of the settlement. The field radius also acts as a warning system to players away from the settlement, if enemies get near the field, a warning sign will flash on the UI telling players that their settlement is under attack. From there, the player can place down the other buildings.

After placing the key buildings, players will be able to go gather up the NPCs. There will be certain interactions between the NPCs and the player. For example, the player can tell some NPCs to go to the barracks and they’ll become armed militia.

**Small Dev Talk: How do you build stuff in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** Building in Planet Explorers is very simple. Find some resources and place the resource back one the ground. You can hit the shift key to drag up or hit the ctrl key to drag horizontal, or mix the two functions. There’s also a free camera mode that lets the player build without having the position of the character limiting the area where can be built upon.

**Small Dev Talk: Your game features the ability for players to create their own vehicles and weapons. How will that work? Do you have a mechanic from preventing players from creating over-powered weapons or vehicles?**

**Zifei:** Players will place prefab parts into an editor, say a hilt of a sword, and then build the sword along the hilt. The hilt itself is used as the point where the player character will hold the sword, the rest are up to the player. We have some pretty advanced algorithms that take into account the sharpness, weight, materials used, and other elements to balance out what the object attributes will be.

**Small Dev Talk: What weapons will the players get to use in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** So far we already have the knife, sword, handgun, rifle, and bow. We’ll be adding more selection as we develop the game.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of creatures and enemies will the player encounter in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** There will be over 100 types of potential enemies for players to encounter in Planet Explorers., from small land creatures to huge sea creatures. There are also aliens in the game, and they will be very tough enemies.

**Small Dev Talk: How will the multiplayer work in Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** There are several components for multiplayer that we’re working on. We made sure to include LAN for our game even though it increases the risk of piracy by a lot because it’s more fun for the player that way. In multiplayer, there are coop and versus modes. Coop can have everything from freeform building, tower defense, to adventure and survival. Versus will have capture the flag, destroy their base, and something along the lines of DOTA.

**Small Dev Talk: Will you be able to bring a map or saved file from adventure, build or story mode and put it into co-op to explore with a friend?**

**Zifei:** That’s the plan! It’ll be hard for story mode as that will take a lot of time, but we’re still aiming for it.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** When we first started working on Planet Explorers, we believed in 2 things. First, space exploration is awesome. And second, the future of gaming will in large part be driven by user generated content. The idea of gathering resources and building what you need was there from the start, but using voxels to do it wasn’t. When we eventually did turn to voxels, the project was already pretty sizable in scope. We’re just big space fans, so we wanted to make a colonization game.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Zifei:** For us, it’s the world that we designed. It’s very unique and very vast. We wanted to give the feeling of being new to a large world that doesn’t really care if you’re there or not. Of course, we like the Creations Editor as well, since it’s fun to see what players come up with.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Planet Explorers?**

**Zifei:** The largest challenge for us is actually just the general efficiency of the game. When you have everything from voxels, customization, AI pathfinding, NPCs, UI, open world and all that, it adds up real quick. Trying to balance everything and have it run smoothly on a lower mid-tier pc is very hard, we’re still working on that.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Zifei:** Just keep at it! When we put out our first alpha, nobody knew about the game and nobody really cared. Now, a few alphas and half a year later, we’re doing much better.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine is Planet Explorers using?**

**Zifei:** We’re using the Unity3D engine, it’s a very easy engine to learn, and it’s powerful enough to deliver some great things.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed you are trying to release your game in Steam as it is currently on Steam Greenlight. If your game does become available on Steam, do you plan on using Steam amazing features such as Workshop and Big TV for sharing user-created content and/or controller support?**

**Zifei:** We’ll decide on that once we actually get into Steam and read up on their documentation. We learned to take things a step at a time.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Planet Explorers and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Zifei:** We aim to launch the final version of Planet Explorers before Feb of 2014. It will cost a one-time fee, we still haven’t decided on the final cost yet, but it’ll probably be around $30.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Zifei:** I just want to ask readers to check out the free 0.53 alpha build of the game at [pathea.net](http://pathea.net/) if they’re interested and support us on [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129199308) and [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1757963851/planet-explorers) if they like it! Thanks all!
