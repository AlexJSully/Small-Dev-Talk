Have you ever wanted your own UV camera to detect fluorescences on your phone? Well check out FluoroVu, crated by Eigen Imaging, a new portable and reliable physical addon to your smart phone that allows you to view and capture Ultraviolet-induced fluorescence images of certain objects and materials. You can find out more on their [website](https://www.eigenimaging.com/fluorovu) or support them on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/857564580/fluorovu-capturing-uv-fluorescence).

**Small Dev Talk: What is FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** In simplest terms, it is a hardware and software package that allows you to view and capture Ultraviolet-Induced Visible Fluorescence images of certain objects and materials. The device consists of a proprietary optics module that is attached to your smartphone or tablet used in conjunction with a specially developed app.

**Small Dev Talk: How does FluoroVu work?**

**Eigen Imaging:** The optics module emits UV light parallel to the optical axis of the smartphone’s camera. Any fluorescence will be captured by the APP’s live camera view. The optics module has a color correction filter that helps bring out the fluorescence against the blue background caused by the UV light.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the practical uses for FluoroVu? Is it meant for professional use or can it be used for the home? Will this be suitable for students in University/post-secondary school?**

**Eigen Imaging:** The FluoroVu can be used almost anywhere by anybody regardless of technical background. All you need is a smartphone or tablet.

Here is a short list of the many applications:

Laboratory, Research and Industrial - Many organic and inorganic compounds and substances exhibit UV fluorescence. Applications include coatings analysis, checking cleanliness of work area, epoxy analysis and quality control.
Identify your valuable personal property. Use it to capture and retrieve images of your personal property that contains invisible markings that you create and only you will recognize.
Education - Fluorescence Demonstration and Analysis. Use the FluoroVu to educate on contamination and cleanliness
Counterfeit verification - check altered/fake documents, counterfeit currency and other official IDs.
Art - Use to the FluoroVu to see hidden fixes paintings, carvings and various objects.
Mineralogy - rocks and gemstone. Different rock and gemstones fluoresce in intricate and beautiful patterns. Use the FluoroVu to get cool images and share with your friends.
Automotive - refrigerant leak detection, locate repaired windshield cracks. The FluoroVu is a convenient tool for field inspection.

**Small Dev Talk: How accurate is the UV detection with FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** The FluoroVu is not for detecting UV. It emits long UV light and detects fluorescence of certain materials that are sensitive to UV light. How well it can capture fluorescence depends on many factors, like the type of materials, ambient lighting, the distance from object to camera, etc. Although it is true that a generic UV light source has the same ability to induce UV-fluorescence, we feel the FluoroVu’s optic module in conjunction with the specially developed APP offer several advantages. First our LED ring light design ensures that the light travels parallel to the optical axis thereby producing more uniform illumination. The optics module also contains a color-correction filter to remove the excessive blue in order to better reveal fluorescent features. Last but not least, the FluoroVu App can be used even on non-UV fluorescent subjects. In other words, it can enhance features even without the use of the optics module. The FluoroVu App uses an image processing method that can bring out color contrast of very faint features in objects that are almost invisible to the human eye.

**Small Dev Talk: What devices and mobile operating systems will the FluoroVu work with?**

**Eigen Imaging:** All android OS smartphones. Iphone versions 3 and 4, Ipad versions 1, 2 and 3. We have had success on a few android tablets but don’t have everything out there to test with. Tell us which model tablet you have and we can look into it. We are currently working on a version that is compatible with Apple devices that have the lightning connector, such as the iPad 4 and iphone5.

**Small Dev Talk: What can the user do on the FluoroVu app besides function the FluoroVu? Will it be able to record what it sees and be imported onto computers for analytic purposes?**

**Eigen Imaging:** The APP allows you take images just like a normal smartphone camera. Therefore the images taken can be exported to reports, presentations and shared with friends and colleagues. The app also allows you to load and enhance an existing image, taken by the device itself or even from an external source.

**Small Dev Talk: What about magnification? Due to FluoroVu being a physical addon to the mobile device, will it have any enhanced magnification?**

**Eigen Imaging:** We have made a prototype version that included a lens for more magnification. If there is sufficient interest we can certainly offer a version with magnification as part of our standard product line. The app has a software (digital) zoom feature to enlarge the subject for easier viewing of small details. If your device has optical zoom, you can use that when taking photos of the subject.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be any desktop version for FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** We don’t have plans to make a desktop version since it is not practical to use in such a set-up.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** The FluoroVu is rooted in the core technology of Eigen Imaging Inc. Drawing inspiration from our background in smartphone APP development, electro-optics and image processing we brainstormed to find a product that was useful for everyone. The FluoroVu is one such product. Naturally we met (but finally overcame) many hurdles. Our first test prototypes consisted of two LEDs attached to a plastic ring, attached to the smartphone using a rubber band.

**Small Dev Talk: What was you and your developers intention and focus of FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** We want to provide people with a cost-effective, portable and easy-to-use device which can help them with work and daily chores.

**Small Dev talk: What is your favourite aspect of FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** Everything, but we especially like the fact that you can use the APP even without the light module.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of FluoroVu?**

**Eigen Imaging:** Cost is a major hurdle. We have to compromise high-end finishes and color choices to keep the cost reasonable. Making our product compatible with all the different models smartphone and tablets has been a great challenge. We had success with many models and are constantly working to expand on compatibility. Products that incorporate the lightning connector by Apple (ie. Iphone5, Ipad4) are proving to be much more challenging. But we strongly feel that a solution is soon forthcoming.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for developers creating their own devices?**

**Eigen Imaging:** Take one step at a time and enjoy the process. The mistakes you encounter (and you will encounter them) will not be wasted if you learn something valuable from it.

**Small Dev talk: What is the expected release date for FluoroVu and how much will it cost? Will people be able to find FluoroVu in stores and online?**

**Eigen Imaging:** We are running a funding campaign at [www.kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/) which ends on Aug. 22. Backers on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/857564580/fluorovu-capturing-uv-fluorescence) can get it for $39, US shipping included. We have plans to sell the product through our on-line store but do not have an exact date and price since it will depend on the results of our initial funding.

**Small Dev talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Eigen Imaging:** Already we have gotten many interesting feedback from supporters concerning the intended use of the product. Sample areas of applications include forensics, paleontology, chemistry, mining, education, and others. People plan to use it at the office, in the field and/or at home. Anywhere you can take your smartphone you can use the FluoroVu.
