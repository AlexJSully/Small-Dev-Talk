It’s time for a new adventure. Recently I got the chance to talk with Shadow Cube about their upcoming game Memory of Soul. You can find more details about the game at [http://memoryofsoul.com/](http://memoryofsoul.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** Memory of Soul is a third-person perspective action RPG (for Win PC) focused on storytelling and atmosphere building. Gameplay will also include elements from detective adventure games and dungeon crawlers. It’s a 100% indie project, created by a team of passionate people in their spare time.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** Our setting is a snow-covered world inhabited by two cultures. The first are the Frost Bears, warriors from the high mountains, who above all value strength and courage. The second – Technomages – are the constructors of magic-powered machines and devices. Both groups are on civil terms with each other; however, the tension between them is near a boiling point due to a conflict over an extremely rare but more and more widely used resource - magic crystals.

The game tells the story of Meira. She is one of the Seers - humans blessed with an extraordinary gift. Not only can they perceive the corporeal world, but are also able to see the other side – the world of spirits, which allows them to look into one’s soul. One day, she receives an unexpected letter from her old mentor - Elzear. Troubled with the mysterious death of his friend he sends a request for help to his young apprentice. At his call, Meira comes back to her home village for the sake of solving the seemingly trivial mystery.

And that’s where the adventure begins!

**Small Dev Talk: What is Meira like and what inspired you to create this character?**

**Shadow Cube:** First of all she is strong and self-confident. With the help of her unusual skills she makes a living as a detective or, sometimes, as a mercenary. The common folk in the game’s world are usually afraid of the Seers. Their powers give them an advantage in diplomacy and combat - that’s why Seers don’t openly admit to have them unless it’s needed. We wanted to tell a story of such a character. The player will be able to develop Meira’s abilities, but her appearance will be always the same.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the gameplay like in Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** It’s an action RPG with elements of detective adventure games and dungeon crawlers. The gameplay focuses on talking with NPCs, looking for clues in key locations using the detective mode, combat and exploration. We are doing our best to properly balance all of the gameplay elements so that they make following the main plotline more interesting.

There will be a bunch of sidequests, which the player will be able to complete during the main course of the game. Exploration will allow you to uncover mysteries of the past - lore and backstories which will add depth to the main plot, expanding upon the game’s world and its inhabitants.

Moreover, Meira will be capable of using alchemy to create potions aiding her in combat and investigations.

**Small Dev Talk: What are the customizable attack trees?**

**Shadow Cube:** We wanted to add a unique flavour to the in-game combat - that’s why we have designed a system based on, as we called them, “customizable attack trees”. We still need to test this mechanic further before we are able to tell you more about it - some details may change in the near future. The main idea behind it is to give the player a chance to create his own attack patterns. The player can also create combinations of attacks by alternating between sword and magic.

**Small Dev Talk: Memory of Soul is supposed to have a strategic side of combat. Can you explain to us how the combat in the game is meant to be strategic and what the combat will be like?**

**Shadow Cube:** As stated above - we still need to test the combat system properly to be able to speak about it with certainty. We plan to put a bit of strategy into combat by encouraging the player to use specific abilities against specific enemies or against some elements of environment, in order to gain temporal advantage in combat. These ideas are still subject to a change, though.

**Small Dev Talk: What types of environments will the player come across in Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** We do not want to spoil your fun, so for now let’s just say that action will take place mostly in the Eirath village (and a small area around it) situated somewhere between the Frost Bears’ and the Technomages’ territories. The adventure will be linear, with a partially open world. The explorable area gets more and more extensive as the game progresses. We also have several aces up our sleeve, but let’s just say that some mysteries can’t be revealed… on the surface. ;)

**Small Dev Talk: What type of people, creatures and enemies will the player encounter in Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** Mostly some unusual villagers with their own view of the world and their own secrets. And speaking about enemies - the world of the game can be quite hostile beyond the village’s lights, so be prepared to face some wild animals and beasts. We will for sure reveal some of them during the development process.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** A passion for RPG games. That’s our motivation and we would love to continue doing this in the future. The project started out rather inconspiciously - as a result of a meeting of a few people willing to take part in such a project. It started at Lodz University of Technology. Since then we have been lucky to meet a bunch of very talented people interested in contributing to this game (not only from the mentioned university).

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** From the developers’ point of few - the challenge. With our meager resources, having only the time between our classes or after work, we decided to tackle the genre which has always been seen as unsuitable for debutantes. Now we know that developing an RPG game is a lot of work, but we really want to make Memory of Soul happen.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Memory of Soul and how did you overcome them?**

**Shadow Cube:** We come across challenges on a daily basis. It took some time to learn how such a game should be made, but one does not realize how complex RPGs are until he tries to create one himself. The biggest challenges during the development were (and still are) connected with time and human resources, but that’s to be expected with our current work conditions. With most of our members having studies and daily jobs, we can’t put as much work into the game as we’d love to - but we are trying to compensate for that with effort and passion.

Also a huge challenge - which for some of us consumes more time than working on the game itself - is managing the work of others. We work within smaller groups, each focusing on a specific field: programming, design, concept art, 3D modeling or level design.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Shadow Cube:** First of all, don’t create RPG games as the first project. :) Choose something much, much smaller, always trying to realistically estimate your resources and capabilities. It’s better to have some smaller projects finished, than one huge always in development (yep, we know something about that).

Also, always work with people, not alone. It can be hard at the beginning, when everyone’s idea is the best one, but nothing gives such a boost as working together. Learning with and from a friend is a much quicker way to gain experience as well. And in no time you’ll level up as a game developer. ;)

**Small Dev Talk: What engine are you using for Memory of Soul?**

**Shadow Cube:** Memory of Soul is being made with Esenthel Engine. It’s an engine developed in Poland, and we decided to work with it almost from the very beginning of our project. Though we have to say, our programmers had to create a lot of their own tools and systems, highly expanding on the core of the engine.

**Small Dev Talk: Your game is currently on Steam Greenlight which means you are trying to bring it onto Steam. If your game becomes Greenlit, will take advantage of Steam’s great features such as Workshop for any user create content or Big TV for controller support?**

**Shadow Cube:** We would like to clarify one thing. We submitted our project to this initiative only a few days after its launch in the middle of 2012, with the main goal of showing our idea to the Steam community and collecting their feedback. Valve described Greenlight as a wonderful platform for that and encouraged developers to put their games here as early as they see fit. However, back then there was no clear distinction between projects that are early in development, and those that are ready to be released. Fortunately, since this February the creators have introduced new Greenlight category called “Concepts” - in our opinion, because of the current state of the game, transferring Memory of Soul to that category makes more sense. That’s why we’ve done it recently.

It’s too early to speak about being Greenlit, because we still can’t back up our ideas with videos and screenshots of gameplay. For now we are focusing on finishing the alpha version of the game and will think about such things later.

As for Workshop and gamepad controller - we haven’t planned anything about the former, but the latter is already a work in progress. Game will be fully supporting gamepad as alternative to mouse and keyboard.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Memory of Soul and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Shadow Cube:** We are probably sounding like broken record here, but it’s still too early to tell for sure.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Shadow Cube:** Create games! And, of course, support struggling and passionate indie developers (wink, wink), but what’s most important - enjoy their creations! See you around!
