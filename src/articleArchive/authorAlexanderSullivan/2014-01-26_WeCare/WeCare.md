No matter what you did or who you, I care for you and I am here for you <3

Yes

I know this is not professional for us to reblog and I am not sure how long we will keep this on our Tumblr page but this is something that someone needs.

No matter how grateful and how lucky someone can be, sometimes, someone needs someone to talk to and there will always be someone somewhere, either in real life or the virtual world, that will care for you and listen to you.

Stand strong, and no matter what happens, just keep standing. To the developers that follow Small Dev Talk and to anyone else who is simply lively today, remember that nothing is ever end. Everything, is just the beginning to another moment, to another chapter, to another book, to another memory, to another save file, to another smile, and most importantly, to your life.

We care for you and we are here for you!
