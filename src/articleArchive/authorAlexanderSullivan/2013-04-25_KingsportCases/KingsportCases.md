Play it once, play it again! The Kingsport Cases is a new horror where every time you play the game, it is different. Recently I got the chance to talk with Tabitha Chirrick, the head designer and lead writer from Machines in Motion’s new game, The Kingsport Cases. You can find more about this game here at [http://www.kingsportcases.com/](http://www.kingsportcases.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** The Kingsport Cases is a fully procedurally generated horror game set in late 19th century Lovecraftian lore. You play a newly hired Detective who is quickly thrust into the mysteries of the small port town. Collect clues, uncover knowledge, talk to or ignore the townsfolk and suspects, and avoid the darkness which hunts you. At its core, it’s a horror game with a detective/mystery novel twist that will deliver a fresh experience every playthrough.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** The intricacies of the story are hard to go into, since the plot is procedurally generated. Each of the four planned locations (only one will be available in our upcoming alpha demo) have two overarching stories each, with several different possibilities within those stories. The flow of the tale is hugely impacted by not just player choice, but procedurally generated NPCs and their goals as well. In one iteration, the lead cultist may want to sacrifice the Detective, while in another iteration, the lead cultist may want to initiate the Detective. Considering this and the fact that NPC goals change over the course of the story depending on several factors, storylines in Kingsport can become pretty complicated and unique. The important thing to remember is that Kingsport is a dark, mysterious place, with darkness gnawing constantly at its edges. And you’re the only one who has a chance to stop its course.

**Small Dev Talk: What features make Kingsport Cases a horror game? How will you build fear, suspense and/or hesitation in the player?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** We feel the biggest advantage we have when it comes to creating fear is procedural generation (that and our terrifyingly bad character models). Monster spawns and frightening events are randomized, so you truly won’t have any hint or notion at what’s around the next corner–we won’t even know! Watch all the Let’s Plays you want, but your playthrough will be different, and there is no way to know what’s coming. Something else unique to our idea of horror is NPC interaction. Very few horror games utilize this, which is interesting, because although being alone is frightening, darkness is always more striking after leaving the light. The contrast between the social atmosphere and the dark depths of the mystery at hand creates a frightening experience which hits close to home. We’ve found the mere act of leaving a well-lit and populated room for a slightly darker, abandoned hallway to be terrifying all on its own. This, combined with creepy monsters which hunt you, chilling atmosphere, and a system which builds a bunch of tension before releasing it creates a pretty uniquely frightening experience.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of people and/or creatures will the player come across in Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** There are all sorts of people in Kingsport, and thanks to procedural generation (forgive me for being a broken record) characters can be generated to be unique and engaging at an infinite rate! You will be able to interact with high class Lords and Ladies to maids and servants, dignitaries to local crime lords, and eligible bachelorettes to cult-leading Matriarchs. But perhaps more interesting are each character’s secrets and ambitions. One might play the part of the loyal servant, but where do his loyalties really lay? It’s half the fun of discovering who the suspects are. Regarding creatures, you can expect to see well paid respect to Lovecraftian beasties, as well as some original content.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the environment like in Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** The Kingsport Cases takes place in, well, Kingsport, a dark, foggy port town on the coast of Massachusetts. For our upcoming alpha, players will be able to experience one of our four planned locations: the Manor, which is lavishly decorated and dotingly kept by several servants. But much like our characters, you would be safe in asking: is this what the manor really is? Or is it hiding some dark secret? Telling you that now would ruin the fun of anyone expecting to play the game, so I’ll keep quiet. Overall, our environments are all about contrast–about finding the shadowy secret in every place. Things are not always what they seem to be, as it were.

**Small Dev Talk: By the description of the game, it appears the player can make choices on how they want to play the game. What type of choices will the player come across in the game?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** Traditionally, games make choices very obvious for the player. Dark side of the force or light side of the force? Nice answer, bad answer? Return the locket to the grieving mother, or keep it for your own greedy little fingers? This is powerful and completely fine, but we think it can go a little differently. Everything a player does in a game is a choice. Killing a monster is a choice. Skipping NPC dialogue is a choice. Taking the loose coins on the table is a choice. Why should games only provide consequences for choices the designers deemed as “choices”, or worthy to be “choices”? In Kingsport, choices don’t just appear as “Press X” or “Press Y” in special dialogue. Choices are reflected in everything you do and say. Did you talk to the NPC through all the options or did you just skip right to the option which would end dialogue? Did you think that wine on the table was there for you so you took it? Everything you do in Kingsport is a choice, and while not every choice begets a consequence (as is such in real life), what you choose to do in Kingsport will shape your story. You will not be notified when it’s “important decision time”. You get to figure that out for yourself.

**Small Dev Talk: How are you creating a great replay value for Kingsport Cases? How will the story change from each play through?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** Broken record time! Procedural generation (yay)! I think great replay value can be attained in a lot of ways. Great story, great gameplay, great boss fights, great multiplayer…I’ve beaten Kingdom Hearts on Expert mode 100% over a dozen times (I’m serious), but people don’t generally think of the game as “replayable”. What procedural generation does (at least in our case) is create new content each playthrough; something I don’t think many games do. You get to enjoy the atmosphere and the overall feel of the game with different characters, events, and stories each time; it’s almost like getting a sequel the second you’re done with your first playthrough! The story will change depending on NPCs generated, the location you’re in, your actions, NPC goals, and things that happened in the previous case(s) (yep, it carries over!). So the variance is pretty large.

**Small Dev Talk: How is the randomly generated maps, plots, and NPCs going to work in Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** Hopefully cohesively, haha! In all seriousness I could write a graduate thesis on the systems behind these aspects, and it would probably be really boring. To keep it short and to the point, every time you start up a new case the system generates the characters and their goals first, and then creates a map that meshes with the expected outcome of the plot (shaped by NPC goals). Things will start to change and adjust depending on what you decide to do; it’s all quite adaptive.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** A little over a year ago I was an undergraduate student at the University of California Santa Cruz, where I was researching innovative story-telling systems with the Expressive Intelligence Studio there. I fell in love with one of the graduate projects I worked on, called Mismanor, which was incredibly innovative and had this fantastic story-telling engine. Unfortunately, in the end it didn’t work out for much more than a dire postmortem, but with the experience I took from there I set out to start innovating stories in games after I graduated. Conrad Nelson is the 3D artist and one of the programmers for Kingsport , and his experience in procedural music generation (as seen in his first release, Borealis) piqued my interest when we sat down to brainstorm games one day. We both thought: what if we could make every aspect of a game procedural? From there we settled on procedural maps and story, but we’ve really enjoyed it so far.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** I’m guessing “everything” doesn’t qualify as an aspect, huh? Well, I think my favorite part is that to me, Kingsport stands out as unique, in both its genre and in terms of innovation. Working on this game every day is a challenge, but it’s also overwhelmingly awesome. To me, a big part of being an indie developer is saying: what would the AAA industry be too wary of doing? And then I want to do that. The world of games is huge, wonderful, ever-expanding, and open to innovation, and that’s what makes not only Kingsport, but game development in general so rewarding. We know we’re taking a risk with this game and it’s what makes us happy, and proud. That’s not to say if you’re not innovating, you suck, or that innovating is some higher tier of development. Traditional mechanics and stories are like comfort food; when everything else gets weird you can always go back to it. And I think some of the best games are and always will be ones with beautifully scripted, well thought out narratives–no procedural generation at all–like Kingdom Hearts. So, I love that we’re innovating (in my mind), but I don’t think we’re Gods (Goddesses) because of it.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Kingsport Cases and how did you overcome them?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** The biggest challenge, by far, has been the art. When you’re an unproven developer, lacking a skill set, and poor as you’d expect a recent college grad to be, finding someone to agree to a revenue split down the line is basically impossible. Conrad, who I mentioned before, has been a champion throughout development, and took it upon himself to better his 3D skills for the purpose of actually having a game to look at. Not able to produce AAA graphics, we decided on a more cel-shaded style, which unfortunately chases a lot of horror lovers away. Not realistic graphics? Not good enough. It’s sad, but it’s true; though a heart-warmingly large number of people actually seem to like the style.

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like being the Head Designer and Lead Writer on Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** Stressful! Part of being the head designer means making sure all aspects of the game are working cohesively together, meaning the narrative, maps, monsters, events, mechanics, art style, etc. need to mesh into a solid product. The procedural aspect introduces nuances to this process which sometimes take days to solve, and being the head writer means I’m responsible for most written content in this game (currently. Anyone want a job? Just kidding). If you’ve read anything of what I’ve said so far, you can imagine just how much writing goes into this. But the truth is, I love it. I love every second I’m working on this game and I wouldn’t have it any other way. This job has the perfect amount of flow–an awesome balance between challenge and fun!

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** Engage in the game development community. They say to surround yourself with people who will fuel your ambitions, and if your ambition is to be a game developer, then who better to spend your time with but fellow devs! There are hundreds of sites, forums, and IRL conferences to attend where you can engage in this amazing community. Give feedback, get feedback, and immerse yourself in the powerful gaming culture. Too many developers are reclusive until they have a product they want to show off, and then they're disappointed when they don’t get the reception they were hoping for. If you want to be a developer, engage in the culture now, make friends now, help others now, and reap the benefits forever. You can do it!

**Small Dev Talk: What engine are you using for Kingsport Cases?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** We’re building the game in Unity.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Kingsport Cases and how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Tabitha Chirrick:** We expect to launch the completed game in February 2014 assuming our upcoming Kickstarter in May is a success. The current estimated price is $20. We have an alpha demo ready for release in the first week of May, and if the Kickstarter is a success we’ll have closed Beta testing in October 2013.
