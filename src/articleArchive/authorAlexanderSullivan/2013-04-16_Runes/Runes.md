## Runes

Runes is an interesting game, for sure. It utilizes new technology in the gaming world, known as ‘Leap Motion’, and is aiming to be the first large core game that runs on this technology. Recently, I had a chance to interview Kevin Haelterman from Lugus Studios, who are currently producing the game Runes. We chatted and went more in-depth into how this new, intriguing game works. Make sure to support them on Facebook at [http://www.facebook.com/RunesGame](https://www.facebook.com/RunesGame), and also check out their IndieDB page at [http://www.indiedb.com/games/runes-game](https://www.indiedb.com/games/runes-game).

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of game is Runes?**

**Kevin:** That’s a good question, since there’s not a lot to compare to it. It doesn’t fit neatly into one of the existing game genres. You could describe it as a “fast-paced turn-based drawing combat game”. We want it to be the first game for the core-gamers using the Leap Motion hardware.

This game is all about the player’s skills and wits. The player has to learn the runes, their powers and weaknesses. To win, you need the right strategy and perfect timing; it’s like playing a cool, expanded, fast-paced version of rock-paper-scissors.

Oh, and let’s not forget: the game will have both single player (against an NPC) and online multiplayer battles.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there a background story? If so, what is it?**

**Kevin:** There is! The game is set in an alternative version of history, where the Roman Empire never existed, but instead there is a Celtic-Germanic Empire in which druids of different clans fight for political power. Battles take place in temple-arenas and are fought with magical runes.

We didn’t want Runes to be a brainless arena combat game, so early on we had an idea of the setting, the background story, and the places you will fight in. While we don’t plan to reveal the complete background in the first release of the game, there will be a lot of indications and hints about ‘the bigger picture’. We hope to turn Runes in a series of games where we reveal more of the lore.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there any character development (Levelling up, buying equipment etc?) If so, how will it work?**

**Kevin:** We have been thinking about this a lot, but we don’t plan to include character progression elements in the first version of Runes. We want this game to be about your personal skills, where you become a better player by actually learning the runes and their effects, by becoming a better rune drawer and by using different strategies. Think about it as a game of Starcraft, where all players have the same abilities but where personal skills (rather than artificial in-game skills) decide who’s going to win. If Runes is well received we plan on releasing updates and new Runes games in which we might add some type of progression system.

**Small Dev Talk: How will combat in Runes work?**

**Kevin:** The combat will be turn-based. You have to attack and defend in turns. When you can attack, you get a specific amount of time to draw as many runes as you can. When the enemy is attacking, you can draw runes to block the enemy runes. For example, a water rune can block a fire rune. When you get hit, you lose some magic power. The player who can deplete all of their enemies power wins the match. For more information about the battle gameplay, I can recommend to watch our second development video below.

**Small Dev Talk: I noticed your game will utilize something called ‘Leap Motion’. What exactly is it?**

**Kevin:** Leap Motion is an advanced motion sensing device that we connect to our PC. It is able to detect gestures and runes the player draws to play the game. For more information about this technology, you can go to: [https://www.leapmotion.com/](https://www.leapmotion.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: How do you feel Leap Motion will affect your game, compared to using a regular mouse and keyboard?**

**Kevin:** Since the game is being made for Leap Motion specifically (it’s not just a port), we feel that playing the game with Leap Motion is the key to the perfect Runes experience. Drawing and casting runes with a mouse is not as practical and definitely not as cool. Leap Motion, is, for us, the perfect technology to make this game as immersive as possible. The player really has to feel like he is actually casting magic, instead of just pressing a button.

**Small Dev Talk: What game engine does Runes run on?**

**Kevin:** We are using the Unity game engine for Runes. It’s powerful and easy to work with. It enables us to make Runes in a very short amount of time.

**Small Dev Talk: Was there any large problems that you encountered with your game? If so, how did you overcome them?**

**Kevin:** I’m actually surprised that we didn’t encounter any big problems. The development of the game has been going smooth from the beginning. WE have a great team of talented people and everyone is performing magic (and not the Runes type of magic ;) ). It’s been a lot of fun so far and we are all excited about playing the final product.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your personal favourite aspect of the game?**

**Kevin:** I love many things about the game.

What I like the most is how ‘epic’ it feels to draw runes and push the magic towards your enemy. You get a real feeling of power, especially when you are defending and can do a counter-attack.

I also had a cool experience during our first public playtest. Someone was playing the game for the first time and lots of people were watching. It was exciting to see the spectators were engrossed in the game too. When the player did a successful counterattack, everyone was cheering. It’s like a group of people watching an exciting football game.
