The great sequel to Caravaneer is coming soon and I got the chance to talk with the developer, Dmitry Zheltobriukhov from [GamesOfHonor.com](http://gamesofhonor.com/) for their upcoming game Caravaneer 2! You can join their crowdfunding campaign at at [http://www.indiegogo.com/caravaneer2](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/caravaneer-2?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sasdeep&utm_content=link&sscid=51k3_odd5b#/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Caravaneer 2?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** Caravaneer 2 is a free single player browser-based game. It can be downloaded and played offline too, but some features will only be available in online mode.

**Small Dev Talk: Does Caravaneer 2 have a story and if so, what is it about?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** It will certainly have a story, and if everything goes according to the plan, the story will be much bigger and more important than in the first part. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world which has more or less the same style as Mad Max and Fallout universes, with the difference that Caravaneer’s apocalypse was not induced by a nuclear war, but by an environmental cataclysm, which is a subject that I would like to expand a little more in the second part’s story. Of course, the main storyline will not be directly related to the causes of the end of the civilization. You will start the game searching for a disappeared companion and will find yourself in much more serious troubles afterwards. This part’s story takes place 80 years after the first one, so there’ll be no strong storyline connection between them.

**Small Dev Talk: What is new in Caravaneer 2 that Caravaneer did not have?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** Some of the most significant innovations are isometric battles (instead of top-down view), a larger set of more specific skills,  a morale system, more developed reputation factor and more complex relations with different factions as well as slavery, business ownership, electricity, different kinds of food, illegal goods and other, less significant features.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of game is Caravaneer 2?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** Caravaneer is basically an RPG that focuses more on the group than on each character personally, and it also has a trading part which, according to some players feels like some sort of a fusion of Fallout and Oregon Trail (even though I’ve never played the second game myself). It’s an old school game with turn-based battles that is similar to the two games mentioned previously and also has some elements that resemble X-Com, Jagged Alliance and Elite, with some other elements being completely unique, of course.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the focus of the player in this game?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** The most direct way to play the game is to focus on the story and on trading, which consists in buying goods in the places where they are produced and then transporting them to where they are needed and selling them for a higher price there. However, one of the positive aspects of Caravaneer which partly worked in the first part and which I would like to develop a bit more in the second one is an ability to play the game in different ways, like for example, leaving the legal transportation business aside and dedicating yourself to robbing other caravans and then selling the goods they were transporting.

**Small Dev Talk: Will this be a linear game?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** No. I’ll do everything I can to make it as non-linear as possible.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you own your own industry in Caravaneer 2? If so, what can you do with those industries?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** This part is not developed yet, but I’m planning to let the player own industries. The idea is to make the industries work the same way they were working before the player owned them, producing goods out of raw materials or natural resources, but to let the player decide what he wants to do with the produced goods: Automatically sell them at the local market or keep them for himself to transport somewhere else. Of course, there’ll also be some other industry related issues, like taxes and workers’ salaries.

**Small Dev Talk: What can you do in the towns in Caravaneer 2?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** Towns are the only part of the game which I haven’t started working on yet. There’ll definitely be all the options you had in the first part, like hiring people, buying/selling goods, shopping for equipment, healing your people and animals and repairing your vehicles. There’ll probably also be industries you can own, and training facilities where you’ll be able to leave your people for some time for them to improve their skills. There could be other features, such as rented storage or gambling, but I can’t confirm any of them at this stage.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of weapons will be included in this game?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** The same types as in the first part which includes melee, all types of firearms, rocket launchers and grenades, and some new ones: Crossbows, flamethrowers and Molotov cocktails. I want to include a larger variety of melee weapons and make them more effective, especially at the early stages of the game. There’ll probably also be some self-made guns to make the game feel more post-apocalyptic.

**Small Dev Talk: Will this or does this game have any multiplayer options? If so, what type of multiplayer options will there be?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** No. Caravaneer, as it is now, is not designed to be multiplayer.

**Small Dev Talk: What unique features does your game have?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** Well. I only know what things I came up with myself and can’t really tell if they’re completely unique, but I think that the very fusion of RPG and a trading game is already quite original. Then there’s the slavery issue that forms part of a complex morale/relationships/reputation system, a unique skills and attributes scheme, transport management that allows distribution of carts and passengers, and maybe more things which I can’t remember right now.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** If it comes out the way I want, I suppose that the aspect I’ll be most proud of it the very fact that the game has many different aspects and many different layers that allow the player to approach the game in different ways and have an extensive, realistic experience.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on and does this game require high specs to play?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** It uses Flash and an isometric engine I’ve developed myself. There are certain moments when the game may run a bit slow, like when initiating the battle engine or when calculating the AI moves, but generally it does not require high specs.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Caravaneer 2 and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** The game is planned to be 100% free, unless there’ll be some drastic changes, which I don’t believe will happen. The release date has not been set yet. It will certainly be some time this year.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the reader?**

**Dmitry Zheltobriukhov:** There’s a crowdfunding campaign for Caravaneer 2 currently running at Indiegogo ([http://www.indiegogo.com/caravaneer2](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/caravaneer-2?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sasdeep&utm_content=link&sscid=51k3_odfcc#/)), which will be active until April 20th, 2013. Please take a look at the perks we offer there and see if you are interested in any of them.
