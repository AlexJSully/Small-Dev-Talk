**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in CENTS?**

**Christopher Boone:** CENTS is the story of Sammy, an uncommonly smart twelve-year-old girl who uses her gift for mathematics and enlists her “frenemies” to revamp the school penny drive into a major moneymaking operations. Meanwhile, Sammy struggles in her relationships with her single mother, Angela, and her math teacher, Ms. Dyer.

[CENTS](https://vimeo.com/73419769?cjevent=0bdf1d4f832311e980b700270a24060f) Teaser from [Christopher Boone](https://vimeo.com/christopherboone?cjevent=12e8b3fc832311e983f500290a24060e) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/?cjevent=1cb5bfdb832311e9826b00270a24060c).

**Small Dev Talk: Can you tell us more about Sammy Baca and what her personality is like?**

**Christopher Boone:** Sammy is crazy smart. She does calculus in the seventh grade. But she is also a loner and a troublemaker. She keeps her math skills secret for fear of kids making fun of her. At the same time, she is always angling to make money so she can buy a smartphone she really can’t afford.

**Small Dev Talk: How will the other girls in CENT’s penny drive affect Sammy Beca and the stoy?**

**Christopher Boone:** Each of the girls in CENTS makes bad choices because they can’t see two inches in front of their faces and don’t really understand the consequences of their actions until they come back around to affect them.

**Small Dev Talk: How scientifically, actually, mathematically, correct will this movie be?**

**Christopher Boone:** CENTS uses math not only as a defining characteristic for Sammy, but also as a plot device. The story treats the math problem the drives the plot in a realistic way. Math provides an opportunity for our protagonist Sammy, but it also causes problems. And that leads to conflict.

**Small Dev Talk: When do you plan on filming CENTS?**

**Christopher Boone:** We currently plan to shoot this summer assuming we have a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958208495/cents-feature-film) campaign and pull together the rest of our financing.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create CENTS?**

**Christopher Boone:** I’m a father with a young daughter. A few years ago, I realized I had no idea what life would be like for her when she reached adolescence. So like any type-A dad, I read a lot of books about the challenges girls face in adolescence, and I was terrified at the stories of girls using words, looks, and social media to affect each other’s moods and lives. I also thought it would be a great world for a story.

At the same time, I’ve always liked math and wanted to include it in a story if at all possible. I also want to see more girls excel in math. As I considered this world of twelve-year-old girls as the environment for a story, a character with strong math skills emerged in my mind. I wondered, “What if she is embarrassed by her gift for mathematics?” That intrigued me. But I still need a hook to drive the plot. That’s when I remembered the penny-a-day riddle that I describe in our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958208495/cents-feature-film) pitch video.

**Small Dev Talk: Are you trying to bring a moral with CENTS?**

**Christopher Boone:** I’m trying to tell an engaging story eventually with the help of a talented cast and an amazing crew. I want to move audiences and provoke conversations after they watch the film, but I don’t think I’m trying to deliver a moral. I’ll let audiences decide if they walk away from the film with a moral. Once they watch CENTS, it becomes their story, too. That’s one of the things I love about films and storytelling.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the film making of CENTS?**

**Christopher Boone:** We haven’t made CENTS yet, so a whole world of challenges awaits us! Right now, we’re working hard to have a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958208495/cents-feature-film) so we can make CENTS.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming film makers?**

**Christopher Boone:** As an upcoming filmmaker myself, I’d encourage my fellow upcoming filmmakers to write, write, write, find a story that drives your passion, and work hard to turn that story into a film to share with audiences.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for CENTS and where can we watch it?**

**Christopher Boone:** If everything comes together, we plan to shoot this coming summer, then hit the festival circuit in early 2015 with the hopes of releasing the film later in 2015. We have several distribution strategies in mind, but will have to wait and see who steps forward to work with us on distribution. If you pledge $8 or more to our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958208495/cents-feature-film), though, you’ll get a digital download of the film when it’s finished and ready to be shared with our audience.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**Christopher Boone:** Thanks for taking time to read this interview. I hope you’ll check out our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958208495/cents-feature-film) by Sat. Feb. 8 and help us make CENTS. Every dollar counts.
