LifeEssence is a new innovative game that brings together the fun of adventure games and puzzle games. A few days ago I got the chance to talk with the developer of LifeEssence, Anthony from Transcend Emotion and get a new view into their amazing game. You can check out their game here at [http://www.lifeessencegame.com/](http://www.lifeessencegame.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is LifeEssence?**

**Anthony:** LifeEssence is a first person puzzle adventure game. You are an ordinary person but you suffer from mental illness. It’s unique in the sense that the game is centered off of real life experience with Depression. We definitely aim as a team to reach out and show the gaming community Mental Illness in another light.

**Small Dev Talk: Does LifeEssence have a story? If so, what is it?**

**Anthony:** You begin as a young man suffering from Mental Illness. The game shows that he has goals he wishes to achieve but situations in his immediate environment cause difficulty. As the Illness progressively worsens he falls into a world known as Trium. In this world he encounters many beings. People made of shadow that are afflicted by their own pains, spirits, and of course his own memory and recollection. The LifeEssence story is one of healing and discovery but it’s definitely been created to appeal to most everyone. We wanted to make something unique and we’re definitely on our way with that. It’s become a very surreal and moving experience and it only gets better as we continue working on it.

**Small Dev Talk: Who are you in LifeEssence? What is the main character’s story?**

**Anthony:** In LifeEssence you are the ‘Observer.’ this character is a human without a mouth. The reason for this is in his fight with Mental Illness he barred his emotions inside because he felt he would be judged or misunderstood had he spoken about them. Of course, this only made the Illness deeper, it caused more pain. The story of the Observer is centered around mainly Depression and how once in its grips, it’s hard to have it let go. Once a human, as he falls further into Illness he transforms and his mouth is lost. The Observer learns a lot in his journey, primarily about himself but also about other struggling characters. His story is about growth from the lowest depths of his suffering to complete contentment and acceptance.

**Small Dev Talk: What genre does LifeEssence follow?**

**Anthony:** LifeEssence hopes to follow many genres but fit more into the first person puzzle adventure genre. As a developer I see games as a great opportunity to express meaning and depth just like a film can. I want LifeEssence to invoke as many emotions as possible but in a way that movies are capable of, feeling for the characters and their situations, experiencing their victories and their downfalls and really feeling that you are the reason something happened. LifeEssence will have many different genre elements.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of gameplay will LifeEssence have?**

**Anthony:** The gameplay is unique but it also follows other titles. We’ve made sure to incorporate elements from our inspirations but also to throw in completely new and interesting flairs. It’s mainly atmospheric puzzle based but there is combat and environment manipulation using Essence and certain key story Objects.

**Small Dev Talk: What are Essence?**

**Anthony:** Essence are balls of energy that float around the world your character has fallen into. They are basically the life force of this environment which makes them highly coveted and in some cases rare. They exist to give your character as well as the shadow characters power. When in your grasp you can heal, manipulate time, activate environmental objects, and influence others. You have the ability to make a difference in this world using the Essence, but it needs to be used wisely.

**Small Dev Talk: You have never specified who you will be coming across in the game but only mentioned them as ‘they’. Who are ‘they’?**

**Anthony:** 'They’ could be any number of beings, I guess I never noticed I hadn’t explained. In the game you encounter shadow characters as stated before, but also positive beings like Goddesses and Spirits. The shadow of course are negative influences and can at times be dangerous, at other times slightly helpful. The Goddesses and Spirits help direct you to better routes as well as shed light on who you are as you experience their realms.

**Small Dev Talk: Is this game linear or is it open-world?**

**Anthony:** It’s a mixture of both. We’ve made it an option really. If you want to do a puzzle you can, but it isn’t required. The game is split based on the duality of light and dark. Of course to achieve better and more in depth story and experience, the light path which is more linear must be followed. To achieve a different experience, the dark path which is more open-world must be followed. We’ve been making sure to balance both and make sure that you as the player can experience many different facets of this game in a variety of ways.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the environment like in LifeEssence?**

**Anthony:** The environment in LifeEssence is based on Life really. We took what I felt in times of Depression and created environments based on the feeling. The dungeon for instance is a very lonely and dark place that feels claustrophobic and trapped. Other environments are the same way. We’ve made sure to make a progression and balance though because in healing comes better understanding and knowledge which makes things easier and more comfortable.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story of Trium?**

**Anthony:** Trium is basically a realm of choice. When struggling, the main character fell into this place which is very not ordinary and mysterious. I can’t say much about Trium in general without risking spoilers but what I can say is that Trium is a place many people I’m sure are familiar with but haven’t experienced in a metaphorical sense like this game portrays.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create LifeEssence?**

**Anthony:** That’s a good question. I’ve been struggling with Depression since I was twelve years old. I’m now twenty. Mental Illness has surrounded me through my family and friends and I’ve always been drawn to people who have been hurting. This game is a way to reach out and share another perspective on what it’s like to have Mental Illness, and also to hopefully reduce the stigma surrounding it. Often times when I watch the news I see things about crimes committed and the person often has Mental Illness of some sort. I’m hoping that this game will not only be an awesome and fun experience, but also one that makes people think and empathize with those fighting something so vastly misunderstood. Hopefully it will even start more games that are about personal causes like this because I believe everyone should be heard and that equality is important.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Anthony:** My favourite aspect of the game is probably the environment and music. I had contacted many pretty well known bands about this project and I told them about the game and the cause behind it. All of them offered to help. The music fits the atmosphere perfectly and it’s just amazing to experience what once was a difficult time in my life come alive through music and art. Beyond difficult times, the positive comes out even more beautifully. The whole thing has been amazing to develop. I’m proud of many things with this game.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of LifeEssence?**

**Anthony:** There have been plenty. We’ve gone through team changes, hardware issues, financial struggle, and many different things. We’re still making this because we love the idea behind it and I think it’ll be an important game to bring to the world. We still struggle with quite a bit, but the biggest one is finances. We’ll likely be running a kickstarter fundraiser in the near future.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose to use Unity as your game engine?**

**Anthony:** Personally I chose Unity because it has many features, it’s intuitive, and it has a wide following. If we have a hard time we can ask questions using the forums, and also we can present our work. It also has many options for systems to work with. Hopefully after PC, Mac, and Linux we’ll be doing Mobile Ports and beyond.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Anthony:** Advice, definitely.

Keep chasing your dreams. No matter how difficult, anything is obtainable with hard work. Through this project I’ve encountered so much kindness and I’ve even been able to work with some of my favorite musicians to make the soundtrack. As hard as it gets, it’ll get easier.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for LifeEssence and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Anthony:** LifeEssence is aiming for launch sometime this year. We don’t have a set in stone launch date, but we’re aiming for 2013. It will be for sale, but it will be priced within $10-$15. We made it to run on most all systems and since the subject matter is as unique as it is we wanted to reach as many people as possible. I definitely think people will enjoy this game.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Anthony:** Just keep doing what you do. Support indie development. Indie developers take risks to make dreams reality so that you can enjoy the games they make. Beyond that, keep updated at [www.facebook.com/lifeessencegame](https://www.facebook.com/LifeEssenceGame/) (definitely a good community) or [www.lifeessencegame.com](www.lifeessencegame.com), thank you for your interest.
