Recently I got the chance to talk with the director, writer and producer of the film Vessel, Adam Ciancio. A uniquely new upcoming sci-fi drama about a man’s gift to communicate with ET’s. To see the movie for yourself, check it out here at [http://www.vessel-movie.com/](http://www.vessel-movie.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Vessel?**

**Adam:** Vessel is a mirco budget feature film, which is currently in the last stage of postproduction. Actually we’re going into the studio tomorrow to do the final pass on the sound and then it’s off to Final Post in Newcastle where it’s being put together ready for the festival season. In terms of its origins I wrote the film at the end of 2011 and was directing it by mid 2012. Along the way I met Leanne Hanley, Gabrielle Christopher and Jonah Klein who have come onboard as producers.

Small Dev Talk: What genre is this movie and will it have any action, suspense or horror to it?

**Adam:** The film is what you would essentially call a Sci Fi Drama. There aren’t a huge amount of them out there. One recent film that came out that really put the cross- genre on the map was “Another Earth” it played at Sundance and did really well and showed that you can combine the two genres and still tell an awesome story.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the main character like?**

**Adam:** The main character is Ash and he is very much a fringe player. I seem to gravitate to those stoic types that convey more through their face than words. Which is weird because I myself talk way too much. Ash has a gift, which allows him to talk to ET’s, at the same time this gift is a burden and forces him over time to become the insular person that we see in the film. We’re essentially meeting him at the end of his tether where his grasp of reality is pretty tenuous.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will we see in Vessel?**

**Adam:** The characters in Vessel are everyday people we would see every day that would populate a city and occupy someone’s life. Most of them are people that were or have now become part of Ash’s life because of his circumstance. It’s a human story so the interactions Ash has with these people are experienced so he can evoke as much emotion out of himself as possible to keep that fire inside him burning before the gift takes hold of him completely.

**Small Dev Talk: Through the description on the website, it states that the main character has till “the end of the day”. Is this movie entirely based in one day or one duration of him being awake?**

**Adam:** It takes place over the course of one day. We meet him in the morning and we leave him the next morning when he makes his final decision. I like the idea of a story being contained and cyclical. For something like this it hopefully will work in its advantage.

**Small Dev Talk: Where is this movie taken place and is it during the modern era?**

**Adam:** The movie takes place in Melbourne, although I did everything I could to make the city neutral, basically eliminated context so whoever watches it can imagine it’s their city. Hopefully we achieved that, if you’re from Melbourne you’ll probably recognize a few locations but if you’re not I’d say it would be pretty difficult. In terms of time frame its set today but certain technological ideas have gone left instead of right. There are a few props that look different to what we have today but really on the budget we had it’s hard to explore those things too far without becoming a different film altogether.

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any advantages or difficulty to being an independent film?**

**Adam:** The advantage is the freedom you have with your idea. It’s yours and you can explore it anyway you want because there is really nothing at stake in terms of money. The film cost roughly 15K so we have no responsibility to recoup some ridiculous sum over an opening weekend. Your only concern is to create the best film you can, not the most profitable. They’re not always the same thing. Also the speed at which you can move with a small crew and little money means you work at the speed of thought. It basically allows you to be capturing moments as they happen instead of trying to manufacture them.

Ironically the disadvantages are in direct relation to the advantages. Money affords you time which means you’re not hammering through important scenes because you’re losing light and need to have the actor on a plane back home before 10. You can do things over and over and over until you get them right. Plus equipment, especially a grip and lighting truck is nice for those locations and times where natural light is causing you all sorts of headaches.

I guess on top of all that you’re taking care of a lot of the elements yourself that you wouldn’t usually do. Instead of wearing just a directors/producer/writer hat you’re also the films publicist, distributor, social networker and anything else that a budget would allow.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did the actor and crew have to go through to make this movie?**

**Adam:** With the actors I think it was the short time frame in which they had to act out these mammoth dialogue scenes with very limited rehearsal. The rehearsal helped a great deal but for what we could afford schedule wise really pushed the limits. They were amazing though, what they did in that little time was awesome and I owe them a lot. In a perfect world if we had the budget it would have been nice to allocate two days for each of the dialogue scenes but once again you just don’t have those luxuries on a micro budget film.

In terms of the crew the fact they were working for free instead of earning coin on a job that could be paying their rent, mortgage or food bill well that’s tough. It’s testing enough on some sets when you’re getting paid but when you are donating your time it can get a little heated. Luckily for me my crew was awesome. I had gone to film school with some of them and had worked on other projects with others. There was only five or six of us during the second week roaming around the city like a pack of gypsies but it worked. It’s not always smooth sailing but you lessen your chances of Murphy’s Law rearing its head if you have your shit sorted and a few contingencies up the sleeve. You owe that to your crew so I make sure I have every based covered in pre-production.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of this movie?**

**Adam:** It changes every time I watch it. Sometimes it’s a moment where music combines with certain imagery and other times it’s a moment between Ash and one of his acquaintances. I guess I like the idea that it’s not just a hard and fast Sci Fi film but a Drama with Sci Fi elements in it. Also that it doesn’t have a hard and fast structure. I guess it reflects the way in which I wrote it.

If I was to be really glib about it my favourite aspect of this film is that we actually got it made and that it looks and plays like it does for the very limited budget we had. Once again I owe that to the cast and crew.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for this movie?**

**Adam:** I guess after we enter it and hopefully it plays at some festivals we should have it released late this year early next year. How and through what method we’re still deciding.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Adam:** Really just to keep supporting those who are having a crack. People usually do something independently whether it be music/film/business because they have a passion for it but nobody is willing to back them. Whether it’s because they are too young or don’t have the runs on the board. Everyone needs to get their start and doing something independently proves a lot of things not only that you have talent.

Having said that check out Vessel, we just got accepted into the London Sci Fi which will be on next month so if you’re in London and see a huge snaking line of guys dressed as storm troopers and wookies you’re probably in the right spot.
