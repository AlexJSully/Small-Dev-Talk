Recently I got the chance to talk with the writers and directors, Justin Giddings and Ryan Welsh, for their short film, This is Normal. A short film that brings the audience across the journey of Gwen, a deaf women, and her difficult life as a member of the deaf community and her choices to find self-identity, acceptance and normalcy. You can check out the short film at [www.thisisnormalafilm.com](http://www.thisisnormal.com/)

**Small Dev Talk: What is This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** THIS IS NORMAL is a film that asks the question “Is it worth giving up who you’ve BEEN for the maybe you could BECOME?” We all face difficult decisions in life, and this story explores the often-unexpected consequences of major decisions. We also explore themes of normalcy, self-identity, regret, and acceptance.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story of This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** THIS IS NORMAL is the story of a young deaf woman named Gwen who has been “mainstreamed” her whole life. This means that for most of her life she did not speak ASL, nor did she self-identify as a Deaf person. Our story catches Gwen right as she’s at a crossroads to embrace her Deaf identity or undergo a (currently fictional) procedure that would allow her to hear completely. Despite the controversy, she takes the “magic pill” and risks her friends, culture, and identity to confront her deepest fears and insecurities. 

Small Dev Talk: What genre will the movie This Is Normal follow?

**This Is Normal:** Indie Drama.

**Small Dev Talk: What is Gwen like and what is her story?**

**This Is Normal:** Gwen (played by actress Ryann Turner) is a smart but isolated young deaf woman. She comes from a family where the dad’s absent, the mother’s clueless, and the sister’s sympathetic but powerless. She has sensorineural hearing loss that can be augmented with hearing aids. Because of this, her mother aggressively mainstreamed her, so she didn’t learn ASL until she was an adult, never attended any Deaf schools or universities, and finds herself outside of the Deaf culture and community. She’s very close to her sister, Katie (played by Emmy-nominated actress Molly Burnett), who is a musician and a singer. Gwen’s boyfriend, Alex (played by a name Deaf actor whom we can’t announce quite yet), is a poster boy of the progressive Deaf culture - confident, CODA (Child Of Deaf Adults), went to Gallaudet University, etc. He tries to lovingly guide her into the Deaf community, but Gwen reflects so many mainstreamed deaf adults that feel outside of both the Deaf and hearing worlds.

**Small Dev Talk: What conflicts on embracing a Deaf identity will you be exploring in the movie?**

**This Is Normal:** We didn’t want this film to be a Deaf film so much as a human film with Deaf actors. In our research, we found that there were so many different types of deafness and so many different ways that people approached their hearing loss - cochlear implants, hearing aids, mainstreaming, etc. Rather than make a film that tried to get behind one camp or another within the Deaf spectrum of opinions, we focused on the “magic pill” theory. It seems every Deaf person we met has been asked, “If you could take a magic pill to become hearing, would you do it?” We thought everyone could relate to a character where that character could simply take a pill to make their “problems” go away. As filmmakers, we want to ask the question of whether or not it’s worth it. Are those “problems” really problems, or are they indicators of who we are as people and the choices we’ve made? If we could just take a pill and fix stuff, what would the unintended consequences be? Would humanity ever have to be self-reflective if every problem could be solved from without instead of within? We, of course, don’t think of Deafness as a problem, and no Deaf person we spoke too thinks it’s a problem either. However, Gwen represents a group of people who DO tend to have identity issues when they feel unable to participate in the hearing or Deaf worlds. So - if we give a magic pill to a person whose transformation is literally going from four senses to five, what would that look like? And how does that speak to all of us in the audience? 

**Small Dev Talk: Who will be the actor of Gwen?**

**This Is Normal:** An actress named Ryann Turner. Your Deaf readers will, of course, want to know if she is Deaf. She is not (and neither does the character Gwen self-identify as a culturally Deaf individual). This decision was made after much discussion and basically boils down to a few points. The first is that the character of Gwen is very unique in that the character goes from total hearing loss to complete hearing. Their is really no antecedent that we could find, particularly as it relates to the second point: the actress playing Gwen has to be able to modify her accent subtly and over time from a Deaf accent to the accent of a hearing person. Each scene is different. In music, this is called the ability to audiate and it is impossible for an actor with even moderate hearing loss to make those subtle vocal adjustments. Our Deaf contacts agree, and it comes down to a technical ability that allows us to tell the story we want to tell. That being said, we know that there will be controversy but hope that our Deaf friends will see that this movie is a missive to the hearing world. All Deaf characters will be played by Deaf actors.

**Small Dev Talk: Will you include members of the deaf community as actors for your film?**

**This Is Normal:** Absolutely! As I mentioned, all Deaf characters will be played by Deaf actors, and we will have certified interpreters on set. Half the cast is Deaf, and we’re really excited about some of the names that are circling the parts.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will we see in This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** All types! The loving boyfriend in Alex, a supportive friend in Gwen’s Deaf friend Jenny, a crude rascal in her other Deaf friend Dan, a loving sister in Katie, an unsympathetic mom, a distant warm-on-the-outside doctor, an encouraging therapist, etc. This cast is dynamic! And pretty good-looking too! :-)

**Small Dev Talk: Where is the movie taken place and is it during the modern era?**

**This Is Normal:** Los Angeles, the not-too-distant future. In our research, we found a lot of medical studies pushing stem-cell research towards the kind of procedure we made up for the film. I think within the next ten to twenty years, medical research will have progressed to the point where the “what if” questions we ask in THIS IS NORMAL become “what now” questions.

**Small Dev Talk: Why did you choose the title, This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** The word “normal” carries so much emotional weight and everyone generally thinks that the life they lead is pretty close to normal. So when we as people see other people outside of our “normal” daily lives, we tend to marginalize them. One of our Deaf contacts is also a lesbian, and she thought our story could just as easily been about a woman deciding to come out. The title THIS IS NORMAL reflects our desire to make a statement that “normal” is defined by the individual and that, really, the only thing that’s “normal” is that there ISN’T a normal human experience - we’re all different and make different choices with different results.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** I was surfing YouTube and kept stumbling across videos where individuals were getting their cochlear implants turned on for the first time. Like most hearing people (although I do have pretty significant hearing loss in my left ear), my first thought was, “Yay! Good for them, now they can hear!” However, as I watched more and more people go through this with varying reactions that were always emotional but not always happy, I started thinking - wow, what would happen if I could flip a switch and change everything I knew about sensory perception? That led me to the controversy behind cochlear implants, then beyond the controversy to an idea like the magic pill, which I thought would have a more universal message than whether or not CIs were good ideas. 

**Small Dev Talk: How are you connecting this movie with the Deaf community?**

**This Is Normal:** First off, we’ve done a lot of research and connected to a few key Deaf contacts while writing and developing the project. We will be hiring Deaf actors, and our hope is that when the film is made, the buzz surrounding the project will open up a dialogue between the hearing and Deaf community that is more focused on our commonalities than our differences, but at the same time addresses the challenges Deaf individuals face. 

**Small Dev Talk: Are you trying to bring a moral or meaning to your movie?**

**This Is Normal:** Not specifically. Rather than say Gwen’s experience or choice is right and wrong, we try to focus on the unexpected nature that consequences tend to have. We want the audience to decide for themselves what they think is right or wrong presented with the circumstances Gwen finds herself within.

**Small Dev Talk: You are partnered with Fractured Atlas. Who are they and how did you get this partnership?**

**This Is Normal:** Fractured Atlas is a New York based 501c3 non-profit organization that provides Fiscal Sponsorship for creative endeavors ranging from theater to poetry to film and beyond. Content creators submit their project ideas, which are then reviewed by their panel and, if approved, awarded Sponsorship. What that means is that any donation made to our film is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. I write that in all-caps because that’s huge - hands reach much deeper into pockets when they know their contribution is a write-off. Plus, Fractured Atlas is an Indiegogo partner, so that’s allowed us to use the power of crowd funding while offering our donors a tax-incentive. Potential donors can visit our campaign at [www.ThisIsNormalAFilm.com](http://www.thisisnormal.com/). 

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any advantages or disadvantages to creating a short film?**

**This Is Normal:** I’d say the advantages are that we can explore a high-concept story in innovative ways without the pressure to carry the idea for two hours. We can take risks that don’t have the same fallout if they fail as they would with a full-length and fully-budgeted feature film. The only disadvantage is that short films make no money! :-) That’s ok - we’re in it for the story, plus that allows us to have tax-deductible non-profit status. 

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did the actors and crew face in the production and development of this movie?**

**This Is Normal:** I’d say the biggest challenge was trying to tell a universal story but needing to balance the particular needs and concerns of the Deaf culture and community. The first draft is very different from the last one and reflects the research and countless hours of conversation that led to a better understanding - and inclusion - of the Deaf community. Also, the budget. Always, the budget. Donate at [www.ThisIsNormalAFilm.com](http://www.thisisnormal.com/).

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the movie?**

**This Is Normal:** Besides the story, I think my favorite part is how we intend to tell the story. Most of the film will be from the perspective of Gwen, so as her hearing gradually returns, the “soundscape” will change. If a sound is distorted or fuzzy, it will be distorted or fuzzy for the audience. If Gwen is trying to read lips, we are going to accurately show the challenge of lip-reading in the Closed Captions by showing how words and sentences changes as the lip-reader gets more context or misses a word. Our Sound Designer is gearing up for quite the challenge!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for This Is Normal?**

**This Is Normal:** We will be submitting to Sundance in September 2013. After that, we will be releasing screening dates as we coordinate our festival schedule.
