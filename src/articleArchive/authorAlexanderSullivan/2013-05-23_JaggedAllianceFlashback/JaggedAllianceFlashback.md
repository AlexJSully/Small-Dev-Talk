Jagged Alliance is back for another adventure in Jagged Alliance Flashback! I recently got the chance to talk with Andreas & Thomas from Full Control on their upcoming game Jagged Alliance Flashback. You can check out their game at [http://www.jaggedallianceflashback.com/](http://www.jaggedallianceflashback.com/) or support them on their kickstarter at [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2079547763/jagged-alliance-flashback](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2079547763/jagged-alliance-flashback)

**Small Dev Talk: What is Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Flashback is a return the good old Jagged Alliance franchise where we take the mechanics from Jagged Alliance 2 and wrap it in a new story and update the graphics. We stay true to the core turn-based combat system and have modding support as well!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the story in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** The story is a prequel to the original stories. The setting is late 80'ies in the final days of the cold war. You initially get send as a CIA agent to stop a rogue Russian general who tries to pull a “cuban missile crisis” style stunt on the US. But as events unfold, you get left alone and have to survive on the island of San Christobal with or against the US, USSR, drug lords and the local population. You start recruiting and slowly build your mercenary army - leading up to the foundation of the A.I.M. organisation.

**Small Dev Talk: What are some new features that you will be adding to Jagged Alliance Flashback that the other Jagged Alliance’s did not have?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We are adding subtle new features besides the new story. Examples are base management to upgrade liberated towns or military installments, faction system where loyalty towards one part will impact how other factions act towards you. And on the technical side we are getting the game into the Unity 3D engine, which will give a lot of modern features like particle systems, lighting and so on.

**Small Dev Talk: What features will you be keeping form the old Jagged Alliance in this Jagged Alliance?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We are basing ourselves off the Jagged Alliance 2 mechanics. So almost anything you have there will be present plus a few modifications taken from the 1.13 community mod. We have established a small council of modders to help us identify the best improvements so we can work them in.

**Small Dev Talk: Will you be having any returning characters from the previous Jagged Alliance in this game?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Definitely! And even better we will tell the backstories of some of the known characters. How did they start out? Why did they join A.I.M. and become mercenaries etc. And we will naturally add new ones as well.

**Small Dev Talk: How will the deep conversation system work in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** The details are still to be designed, but overall we want to give meaning to a lot of the conversations. As you speak with a story NPC, the answers given will affect faction loyalty, and there will be morale choices to be had. Do you save the prisoner and maybe gain an ally? Or let him suffer and you gain valuable information? Choices matter.

**Small Dev Talk: Developing a Jagged Alliance game means it will have a roleplaying element to it. How will you incorporate the roleplaying element into Jagged Alliance Flashback? What type of player progressions, such as rank or abilities, will you feature in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We are going with the same system as in JA2. It works and is well known to all fans.

**Small Dev Talk: What is base management and how will it work in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** You will start out with a small landing zone and expand your base of operations as you gain access to funds. New additions to your base will add various levels of support options to your squads. From fortifying your base that help against enemy attacks to helicopter pads and recruiting a gunsmith will allow you to repair weapons and research new attachments that increase weapon effectiveness.

But this is not where it ends. In captured villages we would like to rework the militia system from earlier games. Parts of the buildings used in your central base can also be built in villages - e.g. fortify specific buildings, repair shops and medical facilities. But you can’t build an air strip or a hospital, these are things you have to control to reap the benefits. The enemy will actively try to retake lost sectors, so the more you control, the more you have to lose.

So it’s important to defend your central base while spending some resources on expanding your presence on the map. Leaving your base open will allow the enemy to take it, removing the support it gives to your mercenary squads.

This adds much more value to the strategic part of the game and more depth in gameplay.

**Small Dev Talk: What weapons will the player be able to use in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Time typical weapons from the 70/80'ies that were in service at that point in time. We don’t want to do sci-fi.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you tell us how the turn-based combat will work in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** It will be very similar to what players have been used to playing in Jagged Alliance 2. You move your units in real time until you see the enemy. And then you have an action point based system running turn-based for the combat part.

Every action costs action points - movement, reloading, switching weapons and so on. It’s like “seconds” that tick as you do things.

Where we want to make things a little different is in the UI, where we want to give more hints to the player of what’s really going to happen. Where is there cover, from what directions etc.

**Small Dev Talk: How does the cover system work in a turn-based game?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** You can stay behind different objects in the world to gain a cover bonus. This reduces the chances of being hit from the other side. But beware, as certain covers can also be destroyed by the enemy

**Small Dev Talk: Will you be adding multiplayer to this Jagged Alliance? If so, how will the multiplayer work in Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** No - we want to make a deep story driven single player game. So no multiplayer this time around.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** It is one of the 3 famous ancestors of turn-based role playing - Fallout, XCom and Jagged Alliance. Having a chance to make one of these - as well as rectifying some of the mistakes made in Back in Action - was too good to say no to :-)

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** The favorite aspect for me is not Flashback specific, but definitely the part we love the most - mercenary personality. It matter who you play with and who they play with. This part is rather unique to almost any game, and definitely a favorite.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of Jagged Alliance Flashback and how did you overcome them?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** The game is not yet in development. So it’s not a question easily answered :-)

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We are using the Unity 3D engine with our additional turn-based framework on top that we have developed through the last many games.

**Small Dev Talk: How is it like to be an indie company and handle a big game title such as Jagged Alliance?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Sir-Tech making Jagged Alliance 2 was not much bigger than what we are. So just being indie and JA being a well-known game franchise doesn’t necessarily exclude each other :-)

We have been making increasingly complex and better looking turn-based games for quite a while, and we simply see Jagged Alliance as a natural step in the direction of this.

**Small Dev Talk: Are you working with any of the original developers of Jagged Alliance?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Yes - we have Chris Camfield on board as an advisor once we go into detailed design and production. He knows not only how things were made in the code, but also why. And which parts need from attention and improvements.

Additionally we are working with 3-4 modders to have them advise us and help on making the game moddable in the best way.

**Small Dev Talk: What have you guys learned from your past successes with Space Hulk and Frontline Tactics and what mechanics are you bringing over from those games into Jagged Alliance Flashback?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We definitely bring along a lot of code and tried out experiments. All the games we made where not clones of each other, but always tried a different aspect of turn-based games. We have tried action points before, we have used an initiative system similar to Heroes of Might and Magic and so on.

All this experience is something we bring into JA:F and can add the story and conversation parts as our next big feature to work on. Our previous games except Tactical Soldier where not very story driven, so here is where we can innovate.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice to upcoming developers?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We think we took the right path of growing slowly, finding “our niche” and then always improving upon yourself and what you do. You have to crawl before you can walk, so make lots of games!!

**Small Dev Talk: How is it like to develop a game for the main 3 OS’s (Window, Mac and Linux)? It there a difficulty difference between the development of each OS?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** Using a game engine like Unity handles all this complexity for us. That is very fantastic and saves us a lot of time and difficulty. There is still some testing work to do, but the basic game runs on all 3 platforms from day 1 in development!

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected launch date for Jagged Alliance Flashback and will it have a cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** It will DEFINITELY not be free-to-play. We will make a rich and deep single player game without time-sinks and grind mechanics :-)

Costs and launch dates are to be decided in detail as we go into real production later in the year. But we estimate a release date of late 2014 being the best guess right now.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards the readers?**

**Jagged Alliance Flashback Team:** We hope that everyone will help us make this game a reality and support our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2079547763/jagged-alliance-flashback). It means everything to us!
