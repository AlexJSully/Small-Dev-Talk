Haven’t you ever just wanted to relax and play a tabletop RPG but you don’t own a tabletop board game. Well then check out playsets! It is a virtual tabletop game including many maps and characters. It brings enjoyment to all players with entertaining emoticons and status effects. Recently I got the chance to talk with the playsets team and you can find more below or you can check out more on their [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling) or on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/playsetsapp).

**Small Dev Talk: What is playsets?**

**The playsets team:** Playsets is a digital replacement for tabletop maps and miniatures.  Designed to bring rich immersive experiences to any campaign with a focus on storytelling and ease of use.  It excels not only as an enhanced map for game night, but also serves as a shared game board for users who might be divided by long distance.  High quality maps not only serve to pull players into a story but features like real time token movement, emotes, and animated status effects and actions are all designed to give remote players an “in the room” feeling no matter where they are.  We think a digital map should not only replicate what you use graph paper for, but rise above and provide great features that take your stories further.

**Small Dev Talk: Does playsets have a story within the game or any premade stories to play through?**

**The playsets team:** Yes, Playsets will have some premade campaigns that GMs can lead their players through.  We’ve hired a professional writer to come up with stories to help those people looking for some great play sessions without a lot of their own prep time beforehand.

**Small Dev Talk: In your introduction Kickstarter video of playsets, it mentions ‘game master’. Does this mean that the player can create their own stories in playsets? Will the game master have to set-up a custom game before they meet with other players?**

**The playsets team:** That is exactly what we want people to do with Playsets, we provide some really great maps of basic environmental types(like towns or dungeons) with tons of options for layout, and they use them to run their own stories.  In addition to our customizable maps we plan on providing a bunch of extra story props like treasure chests, fire, and traps that help GMs bring the stories they have planned to life for their players.

**Small Dev Talk: Being a Dungeons and Dragons like table top bored game, how is the gameplay itself going to work? Will there be in-game dice or combat mechanics?**  

**The playsets team:** One of our goals is to include as little as possible in terms of enforced mechanics, we want to free users to be as creative as they want when they play. A good addition to a tabletop session should only enhance a play experience, never limit it, and that’s what we strive to do. We want Playsets to work for any RPG system as well.  There are additional gameplay tools we are testing inside of playsets, but we don’t want to just tack on as many “features” as possible, we want them to integrate well with the experience.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of actions will the player be able to do with their character?**

**The playsets team:** We’ve built in a variety of ways for players to use their character tokens, the most important of which we feel is real time token movement.  For us this was an important behavior because it helped to bring back that “in the room” feeling that can get lost in a networked environment.  Players can also trigger animated actions, like attacks, that can add emphasis to the story being told.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of worlds or environments will the player see in playsets? Will users be able to edit or create their own environments?**

**The playsets team:** Our initial release is planned with what we view as some really common basic environments, a forest, town and dungeon.  We then plan to constantly be releasing optional expansion packs of environments for not only more classic D&D settings, but other genres as well.  In fact our first planned expansion is up for vote to everyone who contributes at the starting tier of our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling), we really want the community to be involved in letting us know what environments they want next.

Each of these environments contains 5 major features with 3 very different options, for example replacing a bridge into town with docks, or adding a road through a forest.  Given that a GM could create 243 different towns for his players, and thats before they even start adding additional smaller props and NPCs.  The whole idea is to provide many variations on these environments and make it super fast and easy for a GM to create a space that feels new and different for his players even when its the same map.   We also know that some people are going to want to dive even deeper into customization and thats something we are looking at.  Its a topic we discuss frequently, but not something we want to rush to implement.  One of the reasons we started on playsets is because we weren’t happy with editors that had us spending hours laying down tile in hallways, so we only want to implement that level of control when we can make it as easy to use and delightful as the rest of Playsets.

**Small Dev Talk: What type of characters will we be able to play as and can we customize or create our own characters?**

**The playsets team:** We are starting with a high fantasy setting, so all the beginning tokens will be designed to work in that environment.  We are planning on launching with 12 classic hero tokens, like wizard, rogue, cleric, etc.  Our goal is to make lots and lots and lots of tokens, so that you can find just the right token for your character.  We have discussed doing different racial packs after launch, like elves or dwarves, as well as different armor levels, like a noob set or an epic set.  Each token comes with five color options, so if your wizard specializes in ice magic, maybe you want to be the blue wizard token, or if he’s a fire mage, you might want the red wizard token.  

We currently do not have a way of adding your own artwork for tokens, but we are looking into options for user created content in the future.  In the mean time, we have several [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling) rewards that model an NPC after a backer, so our core NPC tokens will be inspired by the people who helped make playsets a reality.

**Small Dev Talk: How is the co-operative play going to work? Will it be online or will it be over Bluetooth? Will there by voice-chat or text based chat when paying with others?**

**The playsets team:** Online play is definitely where we want Playsets to live, connecting friends all over the country that can’t always be around the same table is very important to us.  We would also like to include the ability to just connect over wi-fi / Bluetooth for those times where your group is in the same place but you can’t get online.

We want to include a voice chat functionality, but don’t want to have to do it in a way that passes along a lot of cost to users, so until we find a satisfactory solution we rely on backgrounding applications like Skype or other VOIP solutions.

**Small Dev Talk: Something that I found unique and makes your game look very enjoyable, entertaining and different is your integration with the emoticons and status effects with the playable characters. What type of emoticons and status effects will the player be able to use and why did you choose to put these into playsets?**

**The playsets team:** Our implementation of emotes was inspired by our days as World of Warcraft raiders.  You didn’t want to interrupt the raid leader so you just emoted to the guys near you to make jokes / commentary on a situation.  The same concept applies to a GM, you don’t want to break their narrative flow but if you aren’t at the same table other adventurers may have trouble seeing your reaction.  You don’t want to break in and just say “My warrior feels sad about the mad lord’s plans to feed him to spiders”, its a lot more fun to just make a couple taps and throw up an emote.  It allows you to be expressive without stealing focus. We currently have 9 basic emotes that we feel should cover your gaming reactions without having a menu that is too cumbersome to navigate for fast reactions.

Status effects was an area we never were satisfied with tokens, even with real physical objects. It was always hard to tell what monster / character had what effect and we felt that this was where we could take an advantage in the digital realm.  We chose 9 basic status effect types that we felt could cover just about any status you needed to indicate on a token and had our artist create great animations for them.  It not only looks great, but really helps users conduct combat without asking the GM which kolbold is the confused one for the tenth time.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create playsets?**

**The playsets team:** The biggest inspiration for Playsets was simply the distance that divided our own gaming groups.  As we grew up and found jobs and families we spread out in the country and sessions became infrequent or impossible to play in the same room.  We tried other solutions for networked games and didn’t feel like there was the right focus so we decided to create our own.  

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of playsets?**

**The playsets team:** The online connectivity, hands down.  Even through just our test sessions I’ve gotten way more opportunities to play tabletop RPGs with friends than we have in many many years.  Sharing immersive experiences with friends across the country is exactly why we were into making this project in the first place and that’s already paying dividends.

**Small Dev Talk: What challenges did you and your team come across in the development of playsets?**

**The playsets team:** Our goal from the outset was to not just produce another type of map, but to push and create something better than just a shared map drawn on paper.  So we actually spent months of time at the outset of the project just testing out maps and how they work.  At one point we had spent weeks of both time programming and making art for super large sprawling modular component maps, and after we got beyond some basic tests we realized it was terrible.  It didn’t feel right, the components were super difficult to fit together in a way that didn’t make them look bad and it was clunky.  It was a huge setback and painful but we had to scrap it and totally rethink how maps work.  After more tests and iterations we finally wound up at how they work currently and are very pleased with the result.  Throwing away all that time and effort is never easy but sometimes its the best way forward.

The interface has also been a huge battle for us, it is both difficult and crucial to our end product.  Playsets is supposed to pull you into a world and then assist you in having an adventure there, and the biggest way to fail to do that is to constantly be getting in your way with clunky UI.  We’ve built, tested, adjusted and scrapped more interfaces all over this project than I care to think about, and at times it can be really frustrating, but I think this sort of dedication to the pursuit of perfection brings the product up to a level that’s above many things already on the market.  

Distance has also been a big challenge for our team.  Our developer lives in Iowa while our artist and designer live in Los Angeles and missing out on working in the same space and having face to face meetings can be difficult.  For about a month at the beginning of the project we all actually lived in the same house and it was a very productive time, but that couldn’t last forever and we were back to our separate places.  Then again if it weren’t for the distance separating us in the first place we might not have felt such a strong urge to build Playsets, so maybe its for the best…

**Small Dev Talk: What is it like being a team of three developing a game like playsets?**

**The playsets team:** It’s defiantly a position that has both benefits and hardships.  We get the advantages of being a small team, like a certain level of agility in development and being able to all meet frequently to discuss important concepts or developments. It’s a lot easier to manage schedules for 3 people than say 30. Plus with an odd number of people we always have someone to act as tie breaker, which we’ve found to be very important.  

However with such a small team you have to be careful about the scope of your project, its real easy to be so ambitious that you create enough work that you’ll never finish.  We’ve done a good job of managing that so far, but the size of our team is actually one of the reasons we are turning to [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling).  One of the biggest things holding back our release is time to create artwork.  Our artist is amazing, but even working at full steam she is just still one person, and some funding would allow us do things like hire help for her and move our release up significantly.  On a small team like this its also difficult to get proper beta testing, the more people that are poking around in your app the better the feedback and therefor finished product.  Another one of the reasons we turned to a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling) campaign is to help find more people who are interested in helping us test and polish, with all of us being involved with just about every decision being made its harder to find unbiased people to test new things on.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any advice for upcoming developers?**

**Alex from The playsets team:** Build projects you are passionate about and want to use yourself, don’t just make something because you think it might be popular.  I’ve worked on a lot of different software and making something that you actually want to use motivates you to keep going. It inspires you to really polish and improve, even after that initial release.  You should be just as excited about that next update or feature as your users or its going to show.  

Finding other inspired teammates is another big one. Throughout this project I’ve had to respond to great, but difficult, ideas from Tony (our designer) and create an app that is worthy of, and can handle, all the stunning work from Bronwyn (our artist) and that’s really motivated a lot of great things about this software.  If its only you working on something its really easy to say “that’s too hard and unnecessary, maybe even impossible” and you don’t try and maybe miss something wonderful.  Find partners that encourage you to push your boundaries, its difficult but the results are incredibly rewarding.

**Small Dev Talk: What is the expected release date for playsets and on what platforms? Also, how much will it cost or will it be Free-To-Play?**

**The playsets team:** If we can secure our funding on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/985647565/playsets-the-future-of-social-storytelling) we are slated to begin our closed beta for backers at the end of November. From there we hope to have our release ready for iOS at the beginning of next year and soon after that we want to launch on additional platforms like OS X and a web app to bring us to other platforms.  We have a stretch goal that would allow us to bring the web release much closer to the iOS one, but the cost of immediately adding additional developers is reflected in its position up that ladder.  Without hitting our basic funding goal however, we could see a greater delay in our launch.

Playsets is designed primarily to be Free-To-Play.  We want Playsets to be an enabler for social interaction and its hard to convince someone to try something new if there is a big paywall up front. We want Playsets to be supported by the content we bring to the table, like additional maps, tokens, and campaigns not putting a tax on each adventurer you add to the party.  

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say towards our readers?**

**The playsets team:** First, thanks so much for taking the time to find out about us.  It’s incredibly hard as a small indy dev to get attention for your project and by simply taking to time to find out more about us we already think you are wonderful.  If you are interested in the project the best thing you can do to help out is spread the word and then let us know what you think.  Hearing impressions and suggestions from the community not only lets us improve our app, but also drives us to work that much harder.  The excitement and support of users is what fuels our late nights and long hours.

Playsets is ultimately about getting together with friends and having a great time and hopefully we can help you do that.  We want to be your portal to great stories, as an enhanced map that replaces the graph paper of your local game, or as the shared space for a group getting together from all over the country.  So we hope that not only can we enhance your existing groups, but inspire greater reach in your new ones, and maybe even pull in someone who hasn’t yet made it to game night.  Tabletop games are the most fun social storytelling we know and hopefully our work makes it even easier for you to have great adventures as well.
