Tactical Intervention is a brand new MMOFPS by OGPlanet that just came out of the BETA circuit and went live. This game comes from the co-creater of Counter-Strike, Minh Le, and seems to have a promising future. We recently had an amazing opportunity to have a quick chat with Minh Le himself about his new game and got a bit more of an in-depth look at some parts of it.

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of a game is Tactical Intervention?**

**Minh Le:** It’s a First-person multiplayer shooter in the same mold as Counter-Strike. It has more interactivity than CS, with the player able to do things such as roll, lean, blind fire, drive cars, rappel. There’s also a lot of equipment that players can use to help them win, such as shields, dogs, environmental items (such as fire extinguishers and propane tanks).

**Small Dev Talk: This game comes from the co-creator of Counter Strike. Would you say it takes its roots from that series as well?**

**Minh Le:** Yea, I was responsible for all of the programming in Counter-Strike so I was able to base a lot of the shooting mechanics from Counter-Strike. I think players who’ve played CS have a fairly easy time getting used to the movement/shooting feel of TI.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there anything that was learned from Counter Strike and improved upon for this game?**

**Minh Le:** I was able to use a lot of the experience I had when programming and designing Counter-Strike to help guide me in developing TI. I learned a lot from the mistakes I made when developing on Counter-Strike.. Obviously, since CS was developed 10 years ago, I’ve gotten better at programming code.

**Small Dev Talk: How does character development work? (Rank ups, weapon shop etc.)**

**Minh Le:** TI doesn’t focus on character development. We try to stress competitive gameplay and I find character development gets in the way of that. I don’t want to segregate players who’ve played the game for a long time from new players. I think that separation should be as natural as possible and not be impeded by things such as leveling up (to increase a player’s stats). We do have a weapon shop where players can buy guns with the game points they earn during combat but we strive to make sure the majority of those guns are attainable thhrough moderate amounts of playtime (ie. we try to minimize the amount of grinding for gear).

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of mission types are there?**

**Minh Le:** At the moment, we have hostage rescue, bomb mode, car chase. We plan on implementing new missions later on.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Minh Le:** I like the features which make it easier for me to help my teammates. Things such as being able to heal your teammates, driving my teammates, providing cover support via a shield, etc.

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any unique features to your game that you feel makes it stand out?**

**Minh Le:** I mentioned most of them above.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Minh Le:** It runs on a modified Portal2 engine (w/ CS:GO's advanced shadow system)

**Small Dev Talk: Did you have any large problems when developing the game? If so, how did you overcome them?**

**Minh Le:** I think our biggest challenge was recruiting employees. Being based in Korea, and having the language barrier of finding people we could communicate with as our core team is comprised of native English speakers, was a big problem.
We never did overcome them as we’re still having issues recruiting employees.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything to say to the readers?**

**Minh Le:** Always try to work with people who share the same vision as you. It’s not easy finding people who you can agree on at a fundamental level, but it’s an absolute nightmare working with people who have core difference in beliefs on what direction to take your project.
Don’t work on a project without having continual feedback from your target audience. Getting feedback on your project as early as possible helps you assess the project’s direction and who you want to cater it to.
