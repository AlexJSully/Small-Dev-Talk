Star Wars: Battlecry is an MMOFPS/TPS that is under development. It takes its origins from Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2, and looks to continue that sort of game with the help of CryEngine, a new and advanced game development kit. I recently had a chance to chat with Deforges, a developer with the Star Wars: Battlecry team. You can check out their Moddb page at [http://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-battlecry](https://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-battlecry), and make sure to support them on Facebook at [https://www.facebook.com/StarWarsBattlecry](https://www.facebook.com/StarWarsBattlecry).

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of game is Star Wars: Battlecry?**

**Deforges:** Battlecry is an first and third person shooter based on the original Star Wars: Battlefront games. It’s the kind of game people have been waiting for a long long time. We’re trying to create the most immersive Star Wars game anyone has experienced to date. Mechanically, Battlecry follows what the team sees as natural progressions of the original games’ concepts. It’s a very ambitious project that has brought a lot of skilled people together, creating something fans still hope for.

**Small Dev Talk: What inspired you to create this game?**

**Deforges:** A love for the movies and games definitely motivated a lot of us to start the project with rocknroll237 and sceluk being the first two original members. The last Battlefront game came out in 2005, a time when some of us were still in elementary school. That game became a part of my adolescence and is always able to invoke a sense of nostalgia. The team has gathered Star Wars fans along with people who just want to be able to create a high quality game.

**Small Dev Talk: What kind of classes will there be?**

**Deforges:** The alpha will include base classes like assault and scout troops. We eventually will add more classes and work our way to include all of the original ones. As of right now our main priority is completing the base of the game and getting it out there for people to try out.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be any special characters, such as Jedi or Sith?**

**Deforges:** This is something that’s been asked a lot by our fans. Hero characters are planned but not a current priority. As soon as we start releasing heroes there is a fear that the fanbase will just become preoccupied with wanting their favorite to be made next. Our character artist, Ben, puts a lot of effort into his work. Characters may take upwards to two weeks for everything to be complete.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be any character development? (Level up, unlocks etc.)**

**Deforges:** We obviously want to reward skill and achievement with incentives but at the same time we don’t want to come off as a COD-clone. There hasn’t been much team discussion on what we think would best but personally I think killstreak perks would be the best course of option. An assault class killstreak would at 5 kills get a damage or armor boost, then a weapons upgrade. We really want this game to be balanced and we players to be focused on playing the objective of the game, not on gaining killstreaks.

**Small Dev Talk: Will there be a ranking system for online play?**

**Deforges:** As of now, no.

**Small Dev Talk: Is there going to be a campaign mode?**

**Deforges:** The campaign mode was something very definitive of the series and as much as we would like to create a single player experience it’s not planned at the moment. We are completely focused on the multiplayer aspect of the game. After we have created all the assets and levels it would be easier to make a campaign but for now people will have to enjoy the mindless open battlefields.

**Small Dev Talk: Will it feature any game modes not included in the original Battlefront, or Battlefront 2?**

**Deforges:** Hopefully! We have a lot of ideas, but we can only poke our coders so much at a time. The game is intended to have elements of strategy and game modes are a great way to change up the way people approach the game. People don’t seem to understand we are more excited than they are to play this game as well!

**Small Dev Talk: Is there going to be space combat as well as regular ground missions?**

**Deforges:** It wouldn’t be Battlefront without Space! The original space battles seemed very similar which is what we want to change. We plan on having spacious interiors of the space ships so every battle won’t be the same. We’re also on the lookout for any suggestions we can use to make space battles more interesting.

**Small Dev Talk: Are there any unique things that you have added to your game to make it special?**

**Deforges:** Space-to-ground combat is something I haven’t seen done in any game so far. That’s one of the newest things we’re trying to bringing to the table. Early tests inside cryengine have been promising but that could all change as we get closer to the end product. For now we are optimistic that this something our fans will go crazy over.

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game so far?**

**Deforges:** The scale. Many of the newer Star Wars games like The Force Unleashed follow one character going through a linear level facing a few storm troopers at the most. The maps we’re trying to create, especially with Hoth, are huge open battlefields that dynamically change depending on how people fight. It was especially important to capture the vastness of warfare that the past games haven’t been able to support.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have a release date in mind for Star Wars: Battlecry? And will it be free to play, or pay to play?**

**Deforges:** Battlecry is a free standalone game that does not require anything except a computer capable of running crysis 2. The alpha is expected to come out Q4 of this year. The team is mostly made up of students with busy ever-changing schedules. We really appreciate the patience our fans have shown so far.

**Small Dev Talk: What engine does your game run on?**

**Deforges:** Cryengine. It’s a beauty that is on the forefront of today’s most appealing games like Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3.

Did/have you run in to any major difficulties in the development of your game? If so, how did you overcome them?

**Deforges:** None so far.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have anything else to say to the readers? (Inspirational comments, etc.)**

**Deforges:** I have to say that you guys give us some of the greatest motivation a team could ask for! I’m really grateful for all the kind words of encouragement people have given us over the past few months. The team and I are trying our hardest to bring you some of the best work we’ve ever done as artists. I hope to be hosting a lot of “play with the devs” sessions in the future. Until then, keep watching us and keep on spreading the word! Thank you!
