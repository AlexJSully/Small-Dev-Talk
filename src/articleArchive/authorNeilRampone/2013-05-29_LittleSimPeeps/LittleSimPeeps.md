Recently, I had a chance to talk with Matt Dalgety, an Indie Developer from Hamilton, New Zealand. He’s been developing video games as a hobby for a very long time, and he has finally decided to take on an idea of his own and make it happen; Little Sim Peeps. The concept of the game is quite intriguing; you can visit his Indiegogo campaign here: [http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/little-sim-peeps?c=home](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/little-sim-peeps#/) , as well as read on to find out more!

**Small Dev Talk: What is Little Sim Peeps?**

**Matt Dalgety:** Little Sim Peeps is a game about raising and caring for your “peeps” as they make decisions, get into mischief, interact with their environment, each other, and have adventures.

Peeps are little creatures, which hatch from eggs and grow up over time as you take care of them. The actions you take, the objects you provide your peep to interact with and the environment will all shape them and their personalities in different ways.

As for adventures, semi-randomly occurring events will happen to your colony of peeps, some destructive and some less destructive than others. Most of these events will be up to your peeps to deal with in whatever way they can (for example: One may be brave and try to protect the colony while others run around in circles screaming). I’m still working out how much the player should be able to interact/stop/start these events and if it could create game balancing issues.

**Small Dev Talk: Where/How did you come up with the idea for the game?**

**Matt Dalgety:** I was inspired by Tamagotchi’s from the 90’s after reminiscing with a friend. Along with Fez, Dwarf Fortress, Terraria, and many other indie games.

**Small Dev Talk: Can you describe the process of the game to us? What is the main goal?**

**Matt Dalgety:** Sure. You’ll start out with a single peep, in an area with the bare essentials for meeting your peeps needs. As the game progresses, you’ll encounter stray peeps which you can choose to take in if you wish, or have more baby peeps born into the colony itself. Maximum colony size is still being decided, which will depend on how resource expensive each peep will be.

The main goal is to keep your peeps alive as individuals and able to survive potentially catastrophic events as a colony.

Some people may want to play more casually, some may want to take on the more brutal challenges. My aim is to let the system decide if your colony is ready to handle certain events before activating them. So if a player is not interested in fighting alien invasions for example, then simply do not train your peeps for combat. Or as another example, if your colony is quite old, then they may have an encounter with a stray comet or meteor shower. Strength will attract strength and power will attract powerful forces.

**Small Dev Talk: What do you think is the most unique aspect of your game, and why does it make it unique?**

**Matt Dalgety:** I think the concept as a whole is fairly unique. I’m trying to create a world where interesting random things happen to your little virtual peeps, while still able to take care of them in a virtual pet sort of way. Comets smashing through housing, punching up alien invaders, stemming the tide of zombie hordes, while making sure your peeps aren’t feeling sad (or hungry) about it! Be sure you don’t accidentally feed them zombie flesh though (or hey, maybe you want to look after a bunch of zombie peeps. I won’t judge.)

**Small Dev Talk: What is your favourite aspect of the game?**

**Matt Dalgety:** So far my favourite part is watching stuff I’ve constructed get smashed by a big ol’ comet. But once the game is complete I think I will enjoy watching peeps react to different situations and events the most.

**Small Dev Talk: On your IndieGoGo campaign page, you say you’ve been developing games for over 10 years. How did you get started with this hobby?**

**Matt Dalgety:** On my 8th birthday I received a Gameboy Pocket, that’s when I realised videogames could come in many different forms and would have a bright future.

In my early teens I became interested in programming, with the intent of making videogames (of course.) My early games may not have been very good, but at least I have enjoyed playing them.

**Small Dev Talk: What programs are you using in the development of Little Sim Peeps?**

**Matt Dalgety:** I’m using Unity3.5 and GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.

**Small Dev Talk: Do you have any inspirational things that you if you could say, you would say to all the other small time developers out there with big dreams?**

**Matt Dalgety:** If you’ve got an idea you think is good, build a prototype and see if it works outside your head.

For the people who are just getting started, check out some tutorials for your tools of choice and keep at it.
