## Hearthstone: Down with the sickness?

Just let me start off with two words: Reno Jackson.

Since his release a few months back, Reno Jackson has quite literally become the all-star card in Hearthstone. The most infuriating, keyboard smashing, swear-inducing, monitor shattering card is now a staple in a majority of professional decks. I mean, why wouldn’t he be? Almost doubling the longetivity of the game, as a card he can switch the flow of the game almost instantly. Great as a card, but also probably the biggest pile of (use your imagination) to come into play, ever.

However, before I get further into my rant, let’s take a look at Hearthstone’s humble beginnings, and an overview of where we are now.

Since its launch in March of 2014, Hearthstone has amassed more than 40 million registered accounts. The game release itself, as well as all of its expansions, have been well-received, none seeming to score any less than a 75% on any game review website. It quite quickly became known as a fun and entertaining free-to-play card game that involves strategy, but is still fairly simplistic.

As of late, I feel as if these expectations may be a bit lacking. As a long time Hearthstone player, I’ve noticed that over the past few months the game (and community) have slowly been taking a turn for the worse. Gone are the days of being creative when it comes to making your decks, and gone are the days of people helping each other out because they want to help someone else enjoy the game. Gone are the days of playing the game, just to play.

Now are the days of copying decks from websites, such as Ivy Veins, which list all the cards and in-depth info you need to win. Now are the days of the community slowly starting to delve into a state of toxicity; the people are ruder and the decks are crueler. Now are the days of everyone playing the same series of decks against each other, just to win. Creativity and passion are at an all-time low; everyone just wants to be Legend. (Example below of deck-lists with reachable ranks, mana curve and cost)

The thing that’s been bothering me the most as of late is the amount of times I’ve run into the same kinds of toxic decks in both ranked and casual play. Any Hearthstone player will know what I’m talking about, but here’s a few examples: Murloc anything (Paladin or Shaman are the most common), Facehunters, Zoo Renolocks, Secret Paladins and Outlast Priests. If I received any amount of money for the amount of times I’ve played against these decks, I would be a rich man. Each game equally more infuriating than the last, the time has come where I log on, do my quests, maybe play a round or two of Tavern Brawl and then log off again. There’s no point in playing ranked or casual because 9 times out of 10, I know what I’m going to go up against (and lose to), and where’s the fun in that? (See below for some of the worst offenders)

Usually, when it comes to situations like this, the phrase “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” comes to mind. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t try, but it’s just so mind-numbingly boring. I don’t feel justified in reaching a high rank using the same deck as 25% or more players who also all reached that same rank with the same deck. I realize that to some degree, having a deck better deck than your opponent does matter… But the amount of irritation it causes to some more casual players like myself is mind-blowing. Every other deck faced in casual is identical to any of the decks listed above, and most of the time whenever I try to get past rank 15 I come face-to-face with a bunch of twinks who lose on purpose to stay in that playing field. Not my idea of a fun time.

However, there is one shining light at the end of the tunnel. One glimmer of hope that may be able to revitalize the game that’s become so, so predictable: Standard Mode.

With or without Whispers of the Old Gods, Standard Mode will re-jig the way things work. Without WotOG, it will make some decks more complicated to pull off because of the lack of minions that will synergize with each other, leading to hopefully some more creativity . With WotOG, the addition of the newest card releases will hopefully revitalize all classes with new legendary-heavy combinations and a some more powerful minions with better options.

This way, with an option to either get face-rolled by all-inclusive decks or perhaps have a fighting chance and being able to win while utilizing your creativity again, you can play whatever you’re feeling that day!

You can check out all of the revealed cards for WotOG [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1068859113156856.1073741885.498467596862680&type=3), and get more information on Standard mode [here](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/19995505/a-new-way-to-play-2-2-2016). Keep your heads up fellow Hearthstoners; the game is set to be getting this much-needed shake up this Spring, and it will come sooner than we think.

[manchestergamemaker](https://manchestergamemaker.tumblr.com/): Honestly, Hearthstone was doomed from the start by virtue of being MTG clone. Any card game that goes public ultimately devolves into everyone copying the latest greatest tier players until someone says “okay, cards xyz are banned” and a new deck takes over. At high level play in MTG it got to the point, I recall where for a time, there were literally only two decks worth playing. They countered each other and who won almost entirely depended on who got lucky with their draws first. A ridiculous situation that no one wants but it is, somewhat inevitable. That’s why the main tournaments worth playing are the ones where you’re given a set of cards based on the bewest expansion and have to form a strategy based on where you land.

It’s also why I tend to enjoy tavern brawl a bunch in HS
