# Small Dev Talk

Small Dev Talk is an independent news source that covers all things from the indie world of entertainment, from games to movies to books to technology and more. Our focus of Small Dev Talk is simply to give the chance of having upcoming developers show off their projects in forms of interviews which include images and video and present it to our audience.

## Getting Started

It is recommended that you use the web-version of Small Dev Talk available at [https://smalldevtalk.net/](https://smalldevtalk.net/) which is an archived version of the original site that is being hosted on [Tumblr](https://smalldevtalk.tumblr.com/). This does require an internet connection to load.

If you would like to run this offline, you can download the Github and remove all of 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexJSully/Small-Dev-Talk/master/' from index.js & index.min.js and it would load offline as well.

To visit specific articles, just change the directory to end with '?' + article name (list of article names can be found in [articleData.json](src\articleArchive\articleData.json)). For example, if you would like to read the Playsets' interview, just change the directory to [https://smalldevtalk.net/index.html?Playsets](https://smalldevtalk.net/index.html?Playsets).
